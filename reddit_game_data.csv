The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,"I averaged 14 ""Best Games of All Time"" lists from the last five years together, and these are the results","# Explanation and methodology

I compiled fourteen different ""best of all time"" lists to create one definitive list. It was originally going to be a top 100 but I ended up having enough data to make a consensus top 200. For each list I gave each game a score based on placement (i.e. one point for 100th place, two points for 99th place, all the way up to 100 points for 1st place). I also gave a certain amount of extra points for simply being on the list--otherwise games that ranked low would get basically no advantage over games that didn't rank at all. The amount differed based on whether the list was a top 50, top 100, top 200, and so on. Making it onto more exclusive lists obviously granted more points. 

# Lists used

I averaged together the following lists, with diverse perspectives and recent publication being a priority in which lists I chose: 

**Media rankings**: Empire (UK, 2023), USA Today (US, 2022), Popular Mechanics (US, 2022), Looper (US, 2022) IGN (international, 2021), Slant magazine (USA, 2020) Game Informer (US, 2018) Games TM (UK, 2018)

**Critic ratings**: Metacritic top 200 Metascores of all time (as of 2023)

**Gamer ratings**: IMDB top 200 user ratings of all time (as of 2023), Ranker top 200 user ratings of all time (as of 2023)

**Critic polls**: British GQ Industry Poll (UK, 2023)

**Gamer polls:** TV Asahi viewer poll (Japan, 2021), Hobby Consolas reader poll (Spain/Latin America, 2021)

The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,"Back at game hunting, looking for some relaxing games","Hey guys, i hate this part of gaming but im looking for a game again, to just play and relax, nothing chaotic, no competition, preferably an open world to just walk around and do nothing, dont know whats out there and i need some options to explore.

Im playing genshin impact atm, eldenring, dead stranding, witcher3, red dead redemption 2, no mans sky were all great and the challenges i had to do to get to the point were im allowed to fully explore and observe the fantasy world wasnt too much but it would be perfect if i could just get straight to exploring with no limit in a beautiful world, new or old as long as i can play on a pc will be fine.

The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,I aggregated more than 700 greatest games lists. Here are the results.,"# The Data

The source data includes any list from a reliable source and chosen primarily by the publication's editorial staff (lists based on reader polls were excluded). More than 100 publications from \~15 different countries are represented. A few lists have platform restrictions but the vast majority are unrestricted. The method is able to handle ranked lists, unranked lists, partially ranked lists, and lists with a one-per-series restriction, so all of these have been included. In total there are 98 all time lists, 51 end of decade lists, \~570 end of year lists (this includes GOTY awards), and 9 miscellaneous lists. A full list of all of the included source data can be found here: [https://www.acclaimedvideogames.com/lists/](https://www.acclaimedvideogames.com/lists/)

# The Method

Lists are weighted according to their age (newer lists are very slightly favoured), and a reputation score assigned to each publication (all of the big gaming publications have the maximum reputation score). Another weighting is then applied that essentially penalises publications for repeating themselves across multiple lists. This prevents the most prolific publications from dominating the final rankings. Then, a program tracks how often each game appears ahead of every other game on lists that they were both eligible for. The matchups on the resulting table are then rigorously cross referenced to determine which games performed the best overall. In short, the games at the top are the ones that consistently beat other highly ranked games, while rarely losing to lower ranked games.

The full list goes all the way to 1000 and can be found here: [https://www.acclaimedvideogames.com/games/alltime/](https://www.acclaimedvideogames.com/games/alltime/) Copying the entire list would take up far too much space, but here's the top 100:

# Background info and where to from here?

This is a project that I've been working on since early 2020. I started it because the current go to sources for gauging the critical consensus on video games, specifically Metacritic and OpenCritic, are both based on review scores. I felt like there was room for a website with a rigorous methodology that ranks games based on lists as well (for some reason there's a slight difference between games that do well in reviews and games that do well on lists). It's still early days (the website only launched last year), but I'd really like for the rankings to be taken somewhat seriously one day. Here's hoping.

The next big project will be adding more platform lists. This won't change much at the top of the list, but it should provide better resolution further down. It may also allow me to increase the list to 1500 games, which would be a nice bonus. It won't happen quickly as it requires a ton of data entry, as well as possibly writing a more careful eligibility checker (the current one is pretty good, but it doesn't always make good guesses when release dates are unknown), but hopefully I'll have at least some of it done by the end of the year. Besides that, I'll be updating to include any important lists that come in. Certain website features also need a bit of attention.

The website is not monetised in any way. There are no ads, affiliate links, subscription options, or donation pages. It will remain that way for the foreseeable future.

  
Edit: The website page numbers are not working on some browsers! This will be fixed soon, sorry!",8352,1432,1720958728.0

The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,"Unpopular Opinion: Stop bashing short games. Quality > Quantity, period.","More Content =/= More Fun

I feel like some gamers are desperately trying to justify long games over short games like length is a sign of quality and that short games deserve to be bashed no matter how good they are. It should be quality > quantity, period. It's getting to the point where some gamers won't even recommend short games because games need to be a minimum of some absurd length like 20-30+ hours. No matter the game. This is utterly ridiculous and it's getting to the point where developers are trying to comply with these ridiculous requests by artificially lengthening the game through unskippable cutscenes or mandatory walking talking segments or a bunch of repetitive fetch sidequests. I don't want that crap just like I don't want a super long movie. No one ever said ""oh man the movie Terminator is great but because it wasn't 2 hours long, I won't recommend it."" Devs, please don't forcefully lengthen your games. I don't want diluted, bloated content. When it ends, it ends. If I want seconds, I'll come back for seconds or I'll be that much more excited for your sequel. The last thing I want to a game to drag on and on and on just to get that 20 hour or 40 hour checkmark. 

Some examples of mostly good BUT FORCEFULLY LONG games that overstayed their welcome:

* Assassin's Creed: Valhalla

* Alien Isolation 

* Shadow of Morder 

* Zelda: TOTK

* FF7: Rebirth

* Most MMOs

Few examples of SHORT but good games:

* Most COD campaigns 

* Deathloop

* Light Nightmares 

* Portal 

*  Still Wakes The Deep


Games that were long but never bloated and didn't get tedious by the end:

* Red Dead Redemption 2

* Morrowind / Oblivion / Skyrim

* Witcher 3 

* Ghost of Tsushima

* MGSV

**Overall:** A fun little conference that was completely free from bloated PR talks and only focused on games (except for the brief segment from Acer). Both of the hosts were great and took any slip ups in stride. Only complaint really is how long it was. And since it's the PC Gaming show, there aren't any massive title reveals, but that's to be expected.

**Favorite Moments**

* Good to hear more about The Sinking City. I really want a new Lovecraftian game.
* Man Eater; You play as a shark who eats people and its an open world RPG. It's crazy enough that it might work.
* Genesis Alpha One sounds really awesome. Definitely on my radar.
* Two Point Hospital looks like a fun twist on the building/management genre. Plus, the host perfectly handled the mic not working situation.
* Rapture Rejects; I'm a sucker for Cyanide and Happiness. The really funny trailer grabbed me.

Let me know if anything is missing/wrong and I will fix it.

The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,I need some help finding a new game to play.,"I should preface this by saying that I'm a picky person. I have to be. Father of two, with a screenwriting hobby after work. Movies are my happy place. Well, good ones are anyway. Which is (edited from objective) subjective. Anyway, I'm rambling. I'm near 40, and have lost my gaming mojo so to speak. 

I've played 2077, Red Dead II, Days Gone, TLOU, Most AC Games, Skyrim, Fallout(s), Dooms, Dead Spaces, Callisto.

Single player games are my jam. The narratives, open worlds, etc. Being older, I've been through Mass Effect, Amalur, Morrowind— name a world, and I've been through it. I didn't enjoy Elden Ring, but Sekiro was excellent because of that sweet, sweet parry. Again, I'm a picky person. 

I have Game Pass, but can't find anything I've wanted to stick with and finish of late. I didn't enjoy Dead Cells— or any procedurally generated game, to be frank. Indies are hit and miss for me. Shooters are okay. Blood Dragon, Crysis 2 and Wolfenstein are all good fun. And yet there is this feeling of ennui I cannot shake.

Yes, it is a first world problem, but I need to shake loose and find something to sink my teeth into. I'm not super into JRPGs, and also own a PS5. Spider-Man 2 was so crammed full of busy-work I didn't (and probably won't) finish it— despite how good it runs/looks. I've beaten the Arkham games a few times now. Mad Max. Mordor. I've been around.

I've been through the Tiger Woods game era. Icewind Dale and Neverwinter Nights. I've beat the Crash games. Spyro. Ratchet and Clank. PES, Madden. FIFA. All played, and played through. I stalled on Starfield— I'll wait for the rest of the game to come out. I beat (and mostly enjoyed Prey). Wu Long didn't hit me right, though I enjoyed Ghost of Tsushima. Not sure if Rise of the Ronin is worth trying as of yet. Nioh was alright. A little bargain-binny/last gen feeling, if I'm honest.

I'm a walking bundle of contradictions, of this I am aware. So I ask the gaming community: what should a picky person like myself try?

*EDIT*

Thanks for all of these suggestions. My brain (and I) really do appreciate it! :)",4,293,1718384862.0
The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,Any recommendation based on my current list?,,6,94,1662783733.0
The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,What the hell is happening to gaming?,"Fallout 4, Battlefront, Destiny, The Division, Far Cry 4/Primal, Halo 5. 

These are all popular games that are well made games. They look pretty, they feel good, and they just ""work"".

So why the hell do they feel so lifeless?  

Take Fallout 4 for example. There is *so much* to do in that game, .more than any other fallout to date but there's no consequences to your actions. You find a terminal here, you pick up some loot so you can build that attachment or mod that armour but all that is put right back into the grind to get better this or that. 

Or Destiny/The Division. Amazing MMOs which are LOADS of fun with friends. Shoot baddies, get loot, and get ever closer to that legendary gun or roll the dice with an engram. But..other than shoot enemies to get "" stuff"" to get better guns to shoot harder enemies, what is there?

Or Battlefront...a game that looks and sounds exactly like Star Wars. I never dreamed it would be this realistic...but the game is shallow..you shoot the same eneimes in the same spots in the same ways,  a stormtrooper is dropped on the battlefield onefore and immediately blown up by a grenade. Another stormtrooper finds his order to ""capture this point"".. The life of the game exists in that tiny area of a large battle of an even larger star wars universe.

Its not about the gaming experience anymore, its about ME. its about MY fun, MY grind to a better wepon or a badass ability.

Take Halo 5. I've never seen so many kickass kills and massive explosions in a halo campaign before. Red team does more kickass shit in the first scene, than Master Chief did in all of Halo 1,2 and 3. Its all about pulling of that "" sick combo"" that sweet Dodge  or quad kill feeds...go online and see Spartans kill each other in flashy yet impractical assassinations while you hear an announcer scream with enthusiasm SNAPSHOT! as you land that sniper no scope.

Where has the attention span gone? No longer do we enjoy a game for the experience, it has to be MY journey.No karma in fallout 4, no moral decisions, no slaver camp thats holding women and chuldren hostage.. No button to or not to destrpy an entire town, no desert wasteland twisted with last dying breaths of capitalistic greed...there os no heartbeat in Boston.. Just a Minecraft wasteland full of supplies for MY journey to become the ULTIMATE badass! 

TL;DR

Amazing games have their soul ripped out and replaced with lotteries (engrams, burn cards, requisitions) Minecraft like supplies who's only purpose is to build you better tools to get better tools (Destiny/Division grind, fallout loot and crafting system) and a single player focus taken out of a Michael Bay movie and a 13 year olds quick scoping montage (explosions and flashy moves, multiplayer medals to reward  basic accomplishelments.)

*EDIT games I enjoyed.

Telltale games (walking dead, wolf among us, game of thrones) I don't mind that my choices don't have that much sway it what happens as long as the story is engaging.

Life is strange: I cheated on this one. I haven't played it but I watched a full let's play of it..amazing game I was hooked the whole way.

Idk if anyone has ever played Tom Clancy's endwar but I absolutely loved that game.

I prefer one of two ways (or both) which kind of contradicte each other. I enjoy a game with possibilities. Whether through upgrades, game mechanics, or effects on the story. A game I can create my own role in the universe (not be ""me"" in the game). Your fallout 3/new Vegas, mass effect, strategy games.


Or a game that has a linear story to tell but it's messy and grey and maybe emotional. It has depth to it and maybe your character is on one side. Ok, I can do this it's ""us vs them"" and that's just our lot in this universe. I'm a Spartan supersoldier and its horrible to hear about the grunt rebellion and the suffering the grunts have gone through but I'm still going to shoot him in the face. Me or him.",969,1175,1458226493.0
The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,A mobile game similar to Walking Dead NML?,"I know we're talking mobile games here so apologies in advance.

I've been travelling recently and decided to play some mobile games. I started playing Walking Dead No man's land and I've actually enjoyed it. I would like to play something similar on mobile but I'm struggling to find anything like it.

For those unaware the game has your bog standard mobile base building stuff, but you have survivors that you send on missions for loot. These missions are non idle/auto and (maybe overstating a little bit) similar to an XCOM lite experience, i.e. you move and perform actions (attack/unlock doors etc) with your survivors. There are different classes of survivors who will also have special abilities such as AoE attacks or guaranteed critical hits. Movement and positioning are relatively important, so it's a bit different from your usual idle/auto RPGs.

It's not an amazing game but it's quite a fun one to have on the go, and I would like to have more of these types of games where there is actual turn-based combat. So just wondering if people might know of any

The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,Having major surgery in September - Looking for recovery gaming recommendations!,"In September I’m having back surgery and will be pretty unable to do much of anything for a few months beyond physio and walking. I'll be off work at least a month. I’m sorting out my list of games to play, but I’m thinking a lot about the first couple weeks where I’ll be on some heavy duty pain killers.

I like a lot of JRPGs and RPGs, though I enjoy most other types of games.

What are some games that don’t require major concentration or a deep learning curve? Not necessarily pick-up-and-play. But just games that aren’t going to hurt my brain system-wise or difficulty-wise.

For instance, I was thinking of jumping into the Persona games but just saw that, apparently, the systems that get thrown at you are pretty convoluted early on.

Games that I’ve beat and enjoyed over the past few years:

Bravely Default 2

Chained Echoes

Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion

Dragon Quest XI

Final Fantasy VII Remake: Intergrade

Final Fantasy XV

Final Fantasy XVI

God of War (2018)

Kirby and the Forgotten Land

The Last Of Us Part 1

The Last Of Us Part 2

Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch

NieR: Automata

The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,"[DISCUSSION] The Last Of Us, Hitman: Absolution, The Walking Dead and every Bioshock game ever: all great games about a middle-aged man protecting an underage girl. Why don't video game protagonists ever protect little boys?","A very popular theme in video games is the middle-aged, emotionally damaged male protagonist protecting an little girl. I'm not against this premise, but it occurred to me that there are hardly any games that center around protecting a little boy.

Why is it that game designers opt for a female supporting role instead? In what way would a video game story change if you were to replace Ellie with Elmer, Victoria with Victor and Elizabeth with Keith?

I'm curious about this topic, so let me know what you think.",4,19,1375435696.0
The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,Looking for new coop survival game suggestions,"I'm looking to scratch the survival itch and I need help choosing my next option until Sons of the Forest comes out in a few months. Must have coop/multiplayer and PVE elements. PVP optional. Looking for something that has looting, crafting, guns, basebuilding, exploration, etc. in and open or mostly open world. Bonus points if it has procedurally generated maps. 

Some survival games that I've sunk the most time into are:

Miscreated, 7 days to die, valhiem, the forest, state of decay 2, dying Light 1. 

Some others that I've played are:

DayZ, deadpoly, rust, no more room in hell, surroundead, 10 miles to safety, the walking zombie 2, raft, no mans sky, sea of thieves.

Some that are on my radar are:

Escape the pacific, deadside, night of the dead, dread hunger.

Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

Edit: was looking for something a little more 3D looter shooter. Where you have to scrounge for guns, ammo, food, craft items, etc.",1,10,1672348222.0

The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,About that Jurassic Park Jeep...,"Hello Reddit,

Kevin Bruner from Telltale here. Today there has been quite the buzz about how Telltale reportedly damaged the Jurassic Park Jeep lent to us at PAX. Telltale (though not myself, personally) has in fact been in regular contact with the owner of the Jeep and the last we heard, he was in the process of completing an insurance claim.

The Jeep was damaged on the way to Seattle, before anyone from Telltale ever saw or touched it.  Telltale used the shipping company that the owner asked us to use. When it arrived we just saw an awesome, well loved, but also well used, Jeep. We had no way of knowing that anything had happened to the Jeep in transport, as it appeared in reasonable condition.  Anyone who came by the show and took a picture with the Jeep can attest that the Jeep looked pretty damn cool, and not obviously damaged. 

The fact that the Jeep was damaged before we had access to it, and some dispute over the amount of damage caused in transport vs. existing damage has complicated the claim, which has made the process take a long time.

But, today I wake up to find that there is a campaign the day before our game launch to discredit Telltale. Since Telltale didn't actually do anything negligent, we've been using the insurance we purchased to cover this, but it has been time consuming. Apparently too time consuming.  To expedite this, I'll be writing a personal check to cover what we understand the damages to be - this way we won't need to hash this out publicly any longer.

Some people seem to think that Telltale has grown into some giant corporation that doesn't care about people anymore. Nothing could be further from the truth.  We started the company to make games that are about writing, acting and atmosphere and not about blowing shit up. Since we've gone out on this limb, we've had some successes (and failures) and earned the chance to work with great licenses like Monkey Island, Back to the Future, Jurassic Park and Walking Dead.  All of our games are super faithful to the licenses, and lovingly crafted to make the best fan experience possible. Fans seem to enjoy them, which makes us super proud. We hate that most licensed games are a driver or a shooter with a license slapped on it, which we've never been about.

So I'll fast track getting the Jeep fixed by paying for it personally, even though I don't like the circumstances this is going down in. Perhaps some of you who are hating on Telltale might be inclined to check out Jurassic Park tomorrow and give us a chance to change your mind.


<edit>
Since this seems to be getting a lot of attention, I'll take the opportunity to mention something that irks me to no end. Telltale != TellTale !!!

The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,I’d love a game with a good post-game.,"You fight your way through thousands of enemies, defeat the big evil, save the world and just stop, stick your sword in the ground and walk away.

The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,An emotional tale from Chernarus (DayZ),"Just had the most emotional moment of all time on DayZ. I was sat atop a construction site, looking around for buildings that had yet to be ravaged by the desperate or the greedy, only to survey a man running with his face straight up in the air, leaned backwards, flailing his arms vertically with a fire extinguisher on his back, attempting to escape about six zombies which he had in a conga-line formation clawing towards him. 

I ran down the stairs and yelled. ""Mate, I've got your back, don't worry!"". I cocked my weapon from the third floor of the construction site, deployed my bipod, and let loose. The zombies were in servitude to the mercy of my M4 assault rifle as they were railed, gut to skull, with my hard earned ammunition. Smoke, blood and the empty shells of 5.56mm rounds filled the air as I strove violently to saving my new companion. He ran into a shed, shut the door, and shoved his head into a wall. 

At long last, they were all dead. Glaringly, I endeavoured to descend the construction site. Rifle in hand, corner to corner, I tactically exited the building and ran across the street to find our friend, who had resorted to removing the rest of his clothing (in order to cope with the stress perhaps?) sat in the shed. He looked up at me and attempted to high five me.

He then proceeded to bomb out of the shed, flailing his arms hilariously and running in circles. Abruptly, he halted dead in his tracks, put both of his arms up in the air and started violently shaking from left to right, in a manner that could only be described as 'wiggling furiously'. 

We looted a few houses together. All of this, without a word. We found many clothes, but he opted to wear none. The only clothing he would accept wearing was a burlap sack which he proceeded to put over his face and run into a wall. This was a man of simple taste. He had a rotten banana in his hand, pants with the star spangled banner on and a bag on his face. But he was happy. A real icon of anti-materialism which we could all learn a lesson or two from.

But then, the horror. The horror. We found a nice place to settle down wherein we found a dead body. He had been looted like a vulture. I go to walk outside when our sack-faced knight valiantly charges out into the street with fists of steel. But fire fought fire, and the steel of another man's sniper round met my friend's disposition of iron. He was bleeding. And fast.

After a minute or so, the sniper popped his head out of a window. It was only for a second, but a second meant the world. Two shots later on my part and his brains are splattered against the family photo of the occupants who used to live there. But there was no time for dwelling on the past. My friend was bleeding and I had to save him. He was unconscious and I had no bandages. No shirts or hoodies I could tear into rags, either. I knew there was only one thing I could do. I got out my defibrillator. A voltage shocked through his nerves, awakening him. I knew it wouldn't last forever, but it was worth it to keep him alive for just that bit longer. In that brief moment of life I brought him, my friend, without another breath (or trousers) to his name, uttered his first and last words from within the recess of his bloodied face bag:

""lol""

The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,Playing through Starcraft II on brutal without a single unit dying - First three missions.,"I posted yesterday that I managed to finish a no-death run of the campaigns on hard... not lets do it again on brutal.

Just tried the first missions, which are pretty difficult. O.o

**Mission 1, Liberation day:** [https://i.imgur.com/y44i79O.png](https://i.imgur.com/y44i79O.png)

\- Fairly easy, you only have Jimmy and his marines; it's all marine micro. Ended up with all of them mostly injured except for one lucky guy.

\- Crux of the mission: One event drops reinforcements in the middle of enemy units, you have to micro two of the marines out of there asap.

\- Cheese: None.

**Mission 2, The Outlaws:** [https://i.imgur.com/GPeruXU.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/GPeruXU.jpg)

\- Hard. You get medics and fight marines, medics, hellions and a siege tank. Bit of marine stutter stepping, that's all, except for the very end.

\- Crux of the mission: That fucking bunker. The only way I got around it was to line up all medics in a row (they survive one salve of the bunker longer than marines) and stutter step towards it with the marines, pushing the medics into range first. Then reload for about 30 minutes till the bunker splits it's shots between two medics equally, which means they actually survive more than 2 shots.

\- Cheese:  I had to land a barracks next to the sieged up tank in the enemy base to force it to unsiege, before walking into range with marines.

**Mission 3, Zero Hour:** [https://i.imgur.com/LIZ89A3.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/LIZ89A3.jpg)

\- Not too difficult, but more macro than before. Mining, upgrades, bunker repair, heading out into the map to rescue stranded NPCs, building turrets, etc.

**-** Crux of the mission: None, really. You just have to know what comes, so you can prepare missile turrets and medics inside your base. Mutas were the biggest threat, killing SVCs that autorepaired turrets.

\- Cheese: None.

So far, so good. Being mildly optimistic now that I made it past that bunker XD",563,26,1704452707.0

**So, out of ALL of these games there are only three new games. One is entirely new (Triangle Strategy) and the other two are MP games (Lego Brawls and the FTP Disney Speedstorm). The industry (not just Nintendo) has a major problem. There needs to be new IP's added to keep the industry fresh and new. It's already evident that gamers are getting tired of all of these re-hashes, ports, and sequels. Also multiplayer online-only games and other GAAS are getting old. There are only a few really popular ones while the others fall away into obscurity.**

Edit: when I typed this up it was in a list. I apologize if this is hard to read ",0,15,1708317048.0
The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,I think it's high time we considered a REAL Zombie FPS game...,"I won't beat around the bush: I fucking love zombies. FUCKING LOVE THEM. I had considered posting this under r/zombies, but I didn't think it would get the serious consideration it deserved. I've played *Dead Rising*, *Left4Dead*, even schooled kids in *House of the Dead* arcade machines. I""ve seen just about every zombie movie out there, watched AMC's *The Walking Dead* religiously and read Max Brooks' *World War Z* and *The Zombie Survival Guide* (in addition to the million or so other novel/novellas/graphic novels that exist). But IMO, there's still not a FPS that measures up to what fans of the genre expect.

COD has already touched on zombies a little bit with World at War and Black Ops, and as much fun as it is, I wonder if a full-length-feature game centered around Z-Day couldn't be successful. Imagine if you will, the military scenarios that would present themselves if a Z-Day actually happened: I see battalion blockades in NYC, soldiers cornered, pinned down, forced to fight seemingly unending waves of zombies. The lines break, you and your team run, fighting through buildings, the streets, trying to get out of the city as the lines fall one by one. Maybe another perpective from another country in the campaign: A soldier in the Chinese Army stationed in a small village in rural China near the mountains. A strange sickness starts to spread, and pretty soon this small mostly farming community is overrun with the walking dead. You have to fight your way down to the river, steal a fishing boat, and get the hell out of dodge. There are so many possibilities: 7 continents worth of playable maps/situations that would be under attack in different ways/scenarios.

I've noticed a lot of the Battlefield and COD franchise is centered in the Middle East (and a lot of people seem to either love it or are wishing for a change of scenery). What if the beginning of the campaign has you starting out as a soldier in war-torn Afghanistan or Iraq on a mission babysitting UNICEF workers as they help civilians injured in bomb strikes, landmine accidents, and military skirmishes? A young boy is brought in with a strange rash and labored breathing. You're stationed outside the tent with a couple of other soldiers (or mercs) when suddenly screaming erupts from inside the tent. The soldiers turn to see blossoms of blood bloom against the tent walls. You rush inside to find everyone inside is either dying, being eaten alive, or in the process of becoming a zombie. Your team tries to fight them off, but to no avail. You fall back to the outskirts of the Relief Zone but your ammo is low. It's down to just you and your buddy, back to back with your pistol, fighting off the town as they succumb to the chaos and seek you out, eager to eat your flesh. Eventually you are overrun; the first zombie bites into your arm, you knife him. The second knocks you down, the gun falling just out of reach. They're on you in seconds, biting, tearing, pulling you apart, eating you alive. The screen bleeds red and then blackness. You have just become the first casualties of World War Z. Cue opening credits...

I think this would have people playing the campaign over and over again. You would be hard pressed to find someone not buying a FPS these days solely for the online competition, and campaigns have kind of fallen by the wayside (they're usually used as a learning device to get the player familiar with strategy and button configuration). If you had a successful, engaging game about fighting through the zombie apocalypse from the perspectives of people all over the world (with multiple expansion packs that could be released) I think people would play the SHIT out of it.

And don't forget multiplayer, that oh-so-holy-grail of internet gameplay. COD: Black Ops gave us the option of bots this time around. I propose another option: zombies. Anywhere between 0-50(?) could be set to respawn on the map at any time. So not only are you fighting against other teams, but you have to deal with the added ante of zombies flanking your team while you try to blow up a bomb in a game of demolition. Maybe even an added game mode where when you die, you come back as a zombie in a ""second chance"" scenario. The screen could go all red-tint and jerky but you have increased melee skills and your're fucking fast. And the maps, OH BOY the maps. Who hasn't wanted to play a FPS in a post-apocalyptic (or hell, APOCALYPTIC) city? Fight your friends as the city burns down around you. In the distance, nuclear bombs go off; airstrikes and reinforcements fly overhead periodically as you combat one another. The aesthetic value could really be upped a notch.

I have a lot of ideas for this, and wanted to give others a chance at a serious discussion for this. I think there's some real potential here, and whoever creates this could have the potential to cash in on not only the initial franchise game, but the numerous expansion sets that could accomodate it.

Call of Duty: World War Z. What do you guys think?

**EDIT:** My frequent mention of the COD franchise is only because it's a FPS I play most often and can relate to others the easiest in terms of campaign and online play. Believe me, I will not be disappointed if this comes to fruition through a different title and developer. What seems to be the general consensus though is that people REALLY FUCKING LIKE THIS IDEA. FPS, RTS, and all other markets are open to a (well-done) game that focuses on this genre. Let's make this happen, people.

**EDIT2:** There's been a lot of support and debate between MMORPGs and FPSs. Personally, I don't get into MMORPGs that much. I work a lot and don't have the patience or man-hours to dedicate to such an extensive game. Perhaps that is why I prefer FPSs. You can put in as much time as you want or as little, and most online sessions only last around 10 minutes max. I can come home from the office, throw in a little COD or Battlefield, rage it up, and then do something else. That being said, I would PLAY THE SHIT OUT OF a zombie-themed MMORPG. It might be the only game that could break my loyalty to FPSs. There's a lot of great ideas bouncing around here. I'm going to work with what I can and what I know, and I encourage everyone else to continue to find a way to utilize your insights as well. I'd also like to thank everyone for the enthusiastic posts (pro- and anti- alike) and what I'm pretty sure is my first front-page post ever. And I didn't even have to put ""Fuck"" in the title...

**EDIT3:** TL;DR Zombies are fucking awesome. And video games with zombies are the tits.

**EDIT4:** This will most likely be my final edit of the night. From what I've gathered, there is a clear split between fans of a MMORPG and FPS. Many would like the option to indulge in survival after-the-fact (in addition to the ""trying to survive"" mentality during the opening hours of Z-Day) much in the same way Mass Effect, Morowind, and the Fallout franchise have done. Many would also like to indulge in the adrenaline junky rush of being a soldier on the front lines against waves of zombies. So what about a compromise? 

Maybe it could be the same universe with linear storylines; one game and it's counterparts (a FPS) would jump around the globe putting the gamer in different situations at different times. Elements of run-and-hide survival could be integrated as well as some cool zombie features for use in online play. The second set of games (MMORPG) would utilize the same universe at the same time, but only with one character that gamers could modify and expand upon as they evolve in the new world (Start off at your own house, attack hits, you have to run-and-hide as you make your way out of the city and into the wilderness? Once there, you can scrounge for items, build a base, meet up with others and fight against the horde, complete quests, etc?). Elements of each game could also appear in both games (take for instance a large military strike in Washington DC that fails horribly. In the FPS you would be a part of the military strike; in the RPG you might see it on a television in a diner or hear it on a short-wave radio at your home-base. Or think about it the other way around. Street gangs (perhaps a very prominent gang, such as MS13) have resorted to looting and raping survivors they come across. In the RPG you face these monsters and stave off attacks. In the the FPS, it is overheard through broadcasts and transmissions that certain street gangs (like MS13) have taken to the streets and are hostile should be avoided at all costs. Just a few ideas. 

Or just maybe something truly **MASSIVE** is in order, like the biggest MMORPGFPS ever seen? Why not? I mean, WoW revolutionized online gaming, and look at the following that's gathered? It sounds like a zombie-themed game of this magnitude is what this world is waiting for. What about something that starts out like a regular FPS with added bits of survival and character mods (with the ability to switch back-and-forth between 3rd person and 1st person perspectives), but as the story progresses and the setting takes a turn for a post-apocalyptic wasteland, it switches to a survival game. The option for gunplay would still be there, and by switching to 1st person it would take on the dynamics of a FPS, but when the smoke clears and the ammo lies in empty casings around you, you switch back to ""adventure mode"". And with multiple expansions based off the same storyline, it can cater to fit different tastes, all while being a part of the larger whole. 

Maybe I've bit off more than I can chew, I don't know. Either way, this post has given me hope. Thanks to all who participated and shared your opinions with me (good or bad). You've helped me browse my way through yet another work day. And now I retire to bed, where dreams of zombies shall dance through my head...

TL;DR If I had room, you would all be in my zombie survival crew.",1033,1520,1299512962.0
The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,"So, i used an AI to explain the events of GTA 6. And it was the weirdest stuff i have encountered","By the end of GTA 5, Michael De Santa finally felt like he could be a good father to his troubled son, but he still had one last mission to complete. A man named Devin Weston was arrested for running a sex trafficking ring, and Michael was hired to get him out of jail. He was transported to a prison in Mexico, but on the way there, Michael's plane was hijacked by armed gunmen and he was forced to crash land in the mountains near Los Santos.

&#x200B;

As they escaped the wreckage, Michael and two other passengers were attacked by a pack of wolves and left for dead. One of them died, but the other crawled away into the wilderness. The man's name was Arthur Morgan—a notorious outlaw from the Old West known as ""Dutch"" who led a gang called Van Der Linde's Gang. Dutch knew that this man could lead him to safety, so he took off into the hills with him. As they tried to survive together in this new wilderness, Dutch decided it was time for Michael to join his gang and help take down their common enemy: The Pinkertons.

The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,How about a Life Simulation game based in the Wild West?,"Before you mention it, yes, we do already have the Red Dead Redemption games, but IMO those are technically open-world action-adventure games where you roleplay as a specific character with pre-established background and lore. There are plenty of other things you can do, yes, but in the end you still follow a predetermined storyline that's already set for you.  

What I'm thinking is more along the lines of The Sims (social life simulator) or Stardew Valley, My Time at Portia/Sandrock (farm life sim), or even something like Mount & Blade Warband, where you get to create your own character and lead your own life however way you want in the Wild West setting, be a simple farmer, a cowboy, a prospector, a hired gun, a bounty hunter, a sheriff, an infamous outlaw, a war veteran, a foreign immigrant from a faraway land, a native American, etc., the possibilities and replay values are endless.

Wild West doesn't always have to be about gunslinger duels or train robberies (even though those are among the best parts), it could offer quite a lot of story potentials for other walks-of-life as well, and that's why I think that if done right, the setting could be perfect for a very immersive life simulation game where you could craft your very own tale of the Old West however way you want.",0,5,1704389935.0

I don't want the game to follow ANY specific story but still have the feel of the walking dead. I know that is like impossible but like a semi procedural generated game with zombies and maybe the whisperers and alexandria but also maybe it'd be all over the world so there would be similar gangs and decisions to be made. Well sit I guess really what I'm asking for is a zombie game that is roughly 18 quintillion times smaller than No Man's Sky, but I think it'd be cool anyways!",2,11,1477266717.0
The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,"Starfield should take lessons from 3 of the biggest ""Space Exploration"" games - A Deep Dive.","> No Man Sky's **""Responsive Structure""**       

Not just the movement is responsive, but its *Systems* and *Mechanics*: Getting on your ship, flying away, transitioning planets, landing somewhere else, getting out of your ship, fast and mechanically straight forward.        
Summoning your *Capital Freighter* ship in 2 seconds flat, going in and out of pulse drive speed whenever you want.        
Imagine if to get to your Capital Ship you had to *""request a summon""* at a specific Space Station, so first get there, land, get out, walk to the panel, request it, walk back out, walk to the other hangar where it spawns, then find it, then get on it.        
Instead you hit a menu, press 2 buttons, and it spawns in front of you (in space).        
""Climbing your ship"" animations are great, the first few times.






> Starbound's **""Hand Crafted Procedural Generation""**.         

You don't just get a *""random assortment""* of trees and buildings thrown into a planet, you get *""Hand Crafted Elements""* that are procedurally re-arranged to form **TRULY new versions** of nearly anything:        
A human village can have a *fountain center*, or a *market*, or a massive *guard tower*, or a *farm*.        
Those in turn can be *big*, or *small*, with *more or less rooms*, with *more or less decorations*.        
A kitchen can have *paintings on the walls*, or a *counter with cabinets*.        
A room can be *bigger*, or *multi-floored*, or *smaller*.        
The game knows *""elements""* that comprise each *""thing*"" and varies them in the generation, libraries with bookshelves, or also with map tables, or also with fossil displays, or also with statues in a castle and secret rooms.        
It not only gives an incentive to explore because, even tho you already seen *""A Castle""* before, you haven't seen *""THIS Castle""* before and its actually **significantly different**. But it also hides chests with collectibles, upgrades, decoration pieces nearly everywhere, so again it values exploration.        







> Outer Wild's **""Depth""**.        

Of course exploration in OW is great because its all hand crafted, you are always seeing new *perfectly-tailored* things until the Credits. But more so than that it nails the 2 very important parts of Exploration:        
* ""Things"" to see.        
* ""A REASON"" to see them.        
Outer Wilds isn't just a cool mystery, its a cool mystery **WITH ANSWERS**. Answers that directly impact on your *gameplay*, allowing deeper understanding of *game mechanics* alongside *story*, revealing *new places* to explore and things to do. And a *REASON* to see them. A *mechanical, story and knowledge based structure* that connects locations.







For comparison, No Man's Sky has a lot of great things but lacks some of that ""depth"". You seen one *""Ruin""* you seen them all, and know what rewards you can obtain from the chest inside of them, to the point where you stop going to them entirely. Lacking ""a reason"" to see them.        
But if those *""Ruins""* had a subsect of hand crafted elements, rooms, decorations, ""encounters"" that were in turn *procedurally re-arranged*. If it had a story that directly connected between other locations rather than a loose lore.         
If it had chests filled with unique *RNG costume items, decoration pieces, collectibles*, not just resources and currency.        
That would incentivize actually exploring them to experience *New Things* in them.







I would accept some jank and some repetitive ""fancy"" animations in Starfield, being Bethesda and all, but I would really expect them to take those game's lessons to heart when considering their **Procedural Generators**, **Quests and Story Design**, and **Mechanical System Structures**.",0,9,1658356380.0

The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,Is it just me or am I actually enjoying fallout 76,"I know this may be an unpopular opinion, but I’ve been playing with friends and playing solo and on both occasions I really enjoy the game. I understand that the servers are god awful and the engine is almost as old as a 3rd grader, but I’m really liking the reward to exploring and the dangers of certain areas. I often find myself scared, genuinely sacred traversing the waste land because of what may lurk ahead. As for there being no npc’s, I love the mystery behind it. for instance I was walking to the whitespings  bunker and on the way I found a gnome holding a hunting rifle and a corpse laying dead in front of it. Or when I found valt  94 (the one with all of the overgrown plants) I found the note about how they where experimenting with different plant life and I was interested with just that but when I found the valt door my imagination when haywire. I was thinking about all the different possibilities of what could have been In the valt, was there a intelligent form of plant life in the valt that took over? Did the plants outgrow the people? I love it. If I’m playing one of the worst games out there and there are better ones please let me know, if I can get that same spark of mystery and wonderance (don’t think that’s a word but you know what mean) please let me know what other games there are then 

 Edit: I should probably make it known that I haven’t play any other fallout game. Yes, yes I know I’m “uncultured” and need to play them but I like this one",9,41,1547603050.0
The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,The story of my GF trying out the new Red Dead Redemption,"So, My GF was trying out the new red dead redemption. And here is what happened.

&#x200B;

She had just bought a new horse, named it Dorothy and went out hunting for the legendary bear.

After some struggling she actually managed to kill the bear and get its pelt! She put the pelt on Dorothy and rode off to camp. At camp she couldn't find any use of the pelt other than selling, so she went to town with it. 

She couldn't find anyone that wanted to buy her pelt there either! 

But my friend heard her looking and told me that she needs to find a trapper, so i told her

""Dear, you need to find a trapper""

""Ok"" she said

She looked at her map, found a trapper and set off on Dorothy.

When she had gotten half way she heard a man screaming.

""Help, help me"".

Naturally she stopped. To her surprise the man jumped her and pushed her off Dorothy!

She screamed. ""No, he stole my horse!""

I was like ""What? Who stole your horse?""

""Him!"" she said pointing at a rider whom i could barely see on the screen.

I said ""Well, you should run after him then!""

Still unable to comprehend what happened she took up the controller and started running after the horse thief.

After just a few moments the thief was gone...

But while running some more she found her saddle!

""The thief must've dropped it!"" She exclaimed

She took it up and continued running after the thief (or at least in the direction he had disappeared)

In her anger she forgot to look ahead and fell down a steep.

""Ahh, i'm going to die!"" She screamed

Blood flew everywhere and she landed in a small river.

The river got colored red. 

The saddle had fortunately not fallen down into the river. She stood up and tried to get to the saddle but it was too slippery.

The mud in the steep was too much for poor Arthur.

Somehow she managed to get a hold of it anyway. but she couldn't get up from the river.

So she tried crossing the river. but the river was too strong and her saddle got lost. 

So without her new horse, saddle, all the weapons in the saddle and bearskin. now on the brink of death. She stumbled downriver and managed to find a place to get up.

&#x200B;

She had no clue where the thief went. She just wanted to get back to camp.

After walking for some time she heard gunshots. Maybe they had horses!

And so they did, but she couldn't get a hold on any because they rode away with all of them. So after even more walking she found and decided to fuck it.

First riding person she came across she killed in cold blood.

But the horse ran away. She took one step trying to run after it when a ""WITNESS"" alert came up.

The witness was riding in a wagon with two horses. So she shot the witness too. This time the horses and wagon stopped! She took the wagon and rode off to town to sell it so she could get something back after loosing so much.

She arrived at town with her wagon. Unfortunately she rode over some poor schmuck...

She was now wanted. once again panicking she jumped out of the wagon and also accidentally shot some random person on the street, increasing her bounty.

The sheriff came and told her to put down her weapon. And so she did. He started walking slowly towards her. 

My girlfriend then of course thought it went too slowly so she also started walking towards the sheriff.

And then all hell broke loose. Everyone started shooting at her. And she started shooting back, almost killing the sheriff!

This is where this story ends, the ""DEAD"" screen popping up.

&#x200B;

Afterwards she told me ""this was the worst day of my entire life""

Only thing i regret is not getting it recorded.",85,11,1540925709.0

The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,Why are people saying modern triple-A games are bad?," 

I've been seeing plenty of videos on YouTube with people with titles such as “Modern Games Suck”, Modern Triple-A Games Are Bad”, and “Gaming Isn’t Fun Anymore”. Especially from Youtubers like Griffin Gaming and Synthetic Man who would bash on these games constantly, and that left me bewildered and confused. Like, what is so bad about these games:

* Persona 5
* Nier Automata
* Baldur's Gate 3
* Spider-Man 2 (2023)
* God of War (2018) and Ragnarok
* Starfield
* Mortal Kombat 11 and Mortal Kombat 1
* Horizon: Zero Dawn and Forbidden West
* Super Mario Odyssey
* Super Mario Bros. Wonder
* Need for Speed: Unbound
* Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom
* Pikmin 4
* The Outer Worlds
* Forza Horizon 5
* Anno 1800
* Halo Infinite (Campaign)
* Control
* Uncharted 4
* Assassin's Creed: Mirage

I can go on and on as I actually like some of these games and let me remind everyone that these are games with mostly positive reviews and are mostly to universally liked yet people. These people haven't seen the reviews from IGN, Gamespot, Easy Allies, and GamingBolt among others, yet these same people would say these are the worst things ever made when these are games made by skilled and talented people and made in top quality.

Like, have any of these people played Flatout 3, Life of Black Tiger, Rambo The Video Game, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 5, Skull Island: Rise of Kong, The Walking Dead Destinies, or any of the shovelware garbage you find on Steam, the Switch eShop, or the PlayStation Store? Those are genuinely bad games right there but people would rope these games into the same category as them. Am I on another planet or something?",3,5,1701376466.0
The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,STALKER just gave me the most amazing gaming experience I've had in years (story inside) ,"I bought S.T.A.L.K.E.R during the christmas sales last year but haven't found the time to play it, until today. I saw a thread about the mod L.U.R.K here on reddit, and thought it was time to give this game a chance. 

After installing the mod, I fired up the game. 

As usual I skipped though the basics as I talked to that guy in the starting room. I went outside as soon as I could and went down the town road, to end up talking to some guy offering me a job. - Something about a flash drive. Sure enough, I accepted that and went out to the main road. Following the road I had to options on which way to go. I took a right as I saw three or four guys walking up the road. When I had gotten a bit closer to them the suddenly out of nowhere open fire. The whole thing puzzled me for a second and I froze, and looked behind me to see if there was anything else they were shooting at. Suddenly I was hit by a bullet and the screen turns red. HOLY SHIT! I'VE BEEN HIT BY A SINGLE BULLET AND I'M ALMOST DEAD!
I ran behind a tree, hoping it could be used for cover. They just kept firing on me as I head the bullets carve their way into the tree stomp. I had to run up a hill to get back to where I came from. Running up there would make me visible for a dangerously long time, but I had no other option. 

First I needed some health. I opened my inventory and found a medkit and prepared to run. Once in a while, the shooting would stop. I guessed that meant they were reloading their guns. As soon as it stopped, or become less noisy, - I ran up the hills; running a tad sideways back and forth in hope that it made me a tad harder to hit. 
There was no fighting these guys. They could hit me a mile away and there was tree, maybe four of them with some kind of assault rifles. And what did I have? I tiny pistol and a short barreled shotgun. There was nothing I could do so I just kept running. 

I made it over the hill. I didn't know if they came after me. I didnt want to check. Maybe the map could tell me where I should go next, and even NOT go next. Predictably, pressing 'm' opened a map, reveling a marked place. I ran up there and met some guys, and we went towards a small town to find this disk drive. Not even a town. Just a bunch of old houses, or a barn. Guns started firing, and I tried sneaking in on the right side of the barn. 
Suddenly, I hear a bang and I start breathing heavily. I'd been shot again, and I had no place for cover. I had to try to take out this guy, fast - or I would be dead this early in the game. My character's heart is beating hard, so is mine. Aiming down the iron sight of the gun, I try to put a bullet in his chest. I miss, and my gun rises itself far above where it was by the recoil. All is lost, and I accept defeat. I hear another shot; but it is not me that hits the ground dead. One of my fellow men had gone in on the other side and at perfect timing shot him dead. 


After clearing the rest of the farm, and getting the flash drive - I went back to the town where I started. But as I came into town, I started seeing dead bodies lying around the corners. The guy who asked me to bring him some AKs earlier was dead as well - but I didnt see any enemies. 

So I went down and delivered the flash drive, wondering if it could possibly be the guys who started shooting at me earlier who had done this. The second I came back up, I started hearing gunshots, and screaming. FUCK! IT'S THEM! They were all standing on the hill shooting into town, taking us out one my one. FUCK IT! I ran away as fast as I could, heading out the town road. I ran straight into tree more of these guys, wearing some kind of green uniforms. They opened fire on me, and while taking a few hits, I somehow managed to get myself up the road going left, behind a tree. Here I was, yet again, behind a tree for cover. It was like the dead guy once said; they all had shitty weapons, which is why he asked me to bring him some AKs if I found any. I wished I could find some, and find them sooner. Maybe things could be easier then, because now I had lost the only friendly place I knew of so far. The town was raided by some military looking people and I had no other place to go but further up the road. There was nothing to go back for, so I started running up to that under-passage I had passed earlier. Surely, they woudnt follow me all the way up here. There was a guy with a guitar there, but he didn't say much. I don't really know why, but I stood there for a couple of minutes. I think the reason must be that that place was the only friendly place I knew of at that moment. I had lost everything up to this point and I didnt know what I would do. The town had been raided and I could not go back to that assignment giver. Good thing he said I didnt have to go back there with that briefcase or whatever it was I had to get. 


Then I thought it was time to move on. As I went outside of the under-passage, two hungry dogs started barking and running around me. I picked up my shotgun in case they got too close to me, and they eventually did. I took down one of them and hurt the other, which then ran off. I felt pretty good about myself at that point; I felt like I had a chance in this world after all. 

But then, someone fired. And it wasnt me. SHIT, they followed me all the way up here after all! The guy in the tunnel took out his gun and started shooting back; but I had already seen the damage these guys could do. We didnt stand a chance against them, but with him drawing the attention I got a chance to run away, once again. 

And I did. As I ran though I started thinking that maybe this would last forever. Maybe they would never stop tracking me down like this. Maybe I had no other choice but to make a stand. A bit further up the road, past that farm I had been at earlier, I saw some houses with a good sniping point out one of the roof tops. I didn't have a sniper rifle, but maybe I could wait it out and maybe they would pass the house; not looking for me in there. I ran down there in a hurry, so maybe they didnt see where I was going. 

I entered though a gate of some sort, and spotted a ladder leading up to the higher levels of one of the buildings. As I was about to climb up, I suddenly saw a black hooded guy above me, aiming at me. Was he thinking of shooting me? Or maybe he's just careful and won't shoot if I leave? I wouldn't take any chances. I didn't come this far just to die by playing with 'chances'. I put my gun up and started shooting. I couldn't see too much of what was happening in front of the gun due to the bright flash out of the barrel, but things got pretty quiet after a few shots. I guess I got him. I climbed up to see a dead man and besides him a AK. I wished I had found this AK earlier, but I had to keep focus on the present. 

On this floor, I had a clear shot out one of the windows, and surely enough, I saw three siluett shadows walking along the road. It looked like they were gonna pass me at first, but then suddenly changed direction. FUCK IT! No more running! With the AK in hand I started shooting like crazy when they got close enough, but it was hard to keep the gun centered, and instead bounced everywhere. I started shooting a single bullet at the time, and managed to kill two of them before they managed to enter the town. 

This leads up the where I am now. I am currently looking down into a small house where the last one is taking cover; if that indeed is the last one of them. 

I just thought I'd put this story out there. I'm no writer, so it's hard for me to pass on my experience through words. God damn, this game is no joke. Or at least not the MOD. It's been a long time since I played a game which actually makes me fair dying in game. Actually, I can't remember that happening before. I hope someone who hasn't played this game yet finds this story of mine interesting and tries this game. From my understanding, the MOD (L.U.R.K) I use pimps the graphics a little and cleans up the UI so might as well start using that from the start like I did. 


Anyways, my final words: Holy shit. This game is no joke. 



*req. tl;dr: played stalker for the first time. Went out of town, military started shooting at me, I ran north, came back, military had butchered the whole town, chased me for 10-20 minutes, super deadly. Wanted to share a amazing moment in gaming with the rest of the world.*

The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,The man who was determined to f*** my s*** up.,"Today I sat down to revisit a game that I haven't played in far too long, Red Dead Redemption.

I started up the game for the first time in months, and I was in Blackwater.  I saw that there was a skull on my minimap, meaning there was a bounty to be had.  I walked over to it, and staring back at me was the ugly face of one Americus Ross.  I tore the poster down, determined to take the man alive for my $600.

I called my horse and was off, I raced across the open plains, and darted through the thick pine trees until I was but a few hundred feet from my target.  I got off my horse and preceded to scout out the location, there was only a half dozen or so men, but I would have to fight my way up a winding path to the top of a hill to take down Ross.  I checked my loadout, and ran in with my semi-auto shotgun.

BAM, one man went down and the others were alerted, as I raced up the trail two more rounded the corner and I went into dead eye; sending a shower of buckshot into each one's sternum.  I quickly reloaded and was off.

I reached the next turn when I was jumped by one of three remaining gunmen, I promptly stuck the barrel under his chin and pulled the trigger, scattering his brains to the winds.  As I went around the turn, I saw the last two gunmen and my target: Ross.  I ducked back around the corner and switched to my personal favorite, the double-action revolver.  They didn't know what hit them.  Two shots to the head for both of them and then it was only Ross.

He pulled his rifle up and got a shot off, hitting me in the shoulder.  But I took a deep breath and sent a round into his elbow, disarming him and stunning him in the process.  He went down and I jogged up, lassoing and hogtying him.  I then threw him over my shoulder, and called my horse.

As my horse approached the small clearing at the top of the winding trail, I was confident that I could take down any bandits that tried to stop me on my way back to Blackwater.

But as I was about to throw him onto my horse, I heard a gunshot.  I turned around just in time to see a bandit, riding on a horse, collide with me.  He threw me and my prisoner off of the cliff I had just scaled so victoriously.

The bandits I thought that I would be encountering on my ride back had spawned in the clearing while I wasn't looking.

Miraculously, me and Ross survived the 20 yard drop, but as I stood up to grab him and book it for Blackwater, I glanced up only to see the same man on his horse fall on top of me, throwing me down another hundred foot drop.

I hit the ground and was immediately greeted with the bright red word, ""DEAD"".

So went my first experience of Red Dead Redemption in months.

TL;DR A guy pushed me off of a cliff.  Twice.

The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,Gears of War: Ultimate Edition review (sort of),"Well I did it, I went back and replayed the Gears of War trilogy. I actually started with 2, then 3 and finally Ultimate Edition. Honestly the series peaked in 2 for me, from the storytelling, worldbuilding, music, narrative and tone. The second game is truly special, but all the potential the franchise had back in 2008 has been sort of squandered since, in my opinion.

That is not to say Gears games are bad, it's just that they mostly feel like junk food to me: delicious, quick bites of concentrated fun you instantly get hooked on, immensely entertaining... but afterwards I always walk away feeling empty, like the experience didn't really satiate me or mean much.

I must say back in 2006 the 1st game got carried hard by its setting and novelty alone, because most other aspects were absent. The music was scarce and only ok, dialogue was mostly dry but got the job done, and there were too many vast and empty spaces with nothing going on, just you walking around a locale and taking in the view. It didn't wow me back then, and it didn't wow me now.

The 2nd game introduced me to the franchise, so it's no surprise I find the 1st so bland, so barebones. I know it's an unfair criticism, but the series never really improved afterwards either. They turned Queen Myrrah into this cringe sex symbol for some reason, the lambent were just dumb and mindless monsters that exploded (instead of an organized and interesting Locust faction waging a complex civil war), the Locust didn't actually have a structured and elaborate society after all (as was heavily implied in the 2nd game), they were all just bloodthirsty creatures blindly following their leader in pursuit of land, with no room for diplomacy or rational thought. It's just such a bummer, man, to see such story momentum and promise just thrown in the trash.

Despite all the jokes, silliness and light-hearted banter between characters, I truly think Epic Games had something special in their hands, but the Gears 3 campaign left me so disappointed I just sold the game back in 2011 and never looked back. I bought Gears 4 in 2018 and it was good, just not good enough to make me try Gears 5. I've gotta say no other franchise offers the satisfaction of a point-blank Gnasher shotgun blast, just stupid fun.

All in all Ultimate Edition is a 6/10, nice introduction to the series, but just like Game of Thrones it nosedives and goes downhill after 2. Just kidding just bought Judgement a minute ago lmao game's like crack cocaine lolololol",0,2,1688784056.0
The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,A good space exploration game for my PC,"I really love No man's Sky (don't judge me), but my PC won't run it. Plus, its 20gb, and i don't have that (my PC is really full). I just wan't a not so demanding (or maybe demanding, i can try to run it at low) space exploration game on which i can fly on my spaceship in space, land on a planet, walk around, leave and explore another planet, why can't i found it?

The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,Can we just talk about how comfortable the ezio trilogy is?,"I can't believe how well made this trilogy is and remastered. I first played on ps3 and having picked the trilogy up a while ago on ps4 I have just started brotherhood after completing 2 and i am in constant awe in how perfectly the creators balance ezio out. For me walking through the truly beautiful streets of rome (i can't explain how good it all looks) i have this sense of calm power. The sense that i am an extremely deadly man capable of killing pretty much anyone who even looks at me wrong and able to take down groups of 10 (which is pretty fun to do) but at the same this sense of.. not needing or wanting to fight. Other games like it encourage you to fight even other AC games, giving you all these powers and skills making you into this pure powerhouse forcing you into big fights but something about the way ezio walks and talks is just calming. The character has this steady walk/run that is of a man who is calm in his skin but not brash. You can easily tell how much he has grown up since 2

At the same time the game has a very good way of showing me my limits. Yes ezio is extremely deadly but there is a thousand of them and one of you and you very much can get overwhelmed. As a example, there are side missions in brotherhood running around Roma where you can hunt down and kill commanders that are defending little sections of the city keeping it under enemy control and when you kill them and burn down a tower, it allows you to buy businesses and buy stuff in that bit of the city, one of the commanders i had to kill was hiding 3 stories underground which forced me to run like a man on fire through 20 guards in a courtyard and down the stairs being chased all the while pissing off about another 8 in the process running down the stairs all to kill one guy, killing said guy i turned around my back to a wall to 10 guards of different types surrounding me.. It's a humbling experience. ""An assassin doesn't die easily"" It does a very good job at not just teaching you but showing you the power of keeping your strategy balanced. Sure you can run into a building sword out and crossbow at the ready but why not just consider scaling upwards? why run through the city streets fighting each enemy when there's any hundred of ways to the roof where you can just as easily avoid a fight. It makes you think each individual situation through fully. The variety of ways to kill too!

Speaking of more than just ezio (that's a fun name to think and say) can i just talk about how comfortably the game flows? in other games in the series (i've played through the ps3 era games) i've noticed it's not overly difficult to get messed up with jumping and get stuck somewhere or to not grab the walls right but in this remaster it all feels right. the camera sensitivity is just right so that you can smoothly walk around corners and jump across buildings and down without having to get ezio in a proper position. There are still a few times i find myself yelling ""ezio auditore da firenze! get on the wall"" or variants like an angry mother but it's rather rare and a second try is all it takes. There is a bit of a funky thing with standing on roof edges with enemy troops as they try to hit you and you can't get off the edge properly but that's again minor.

Everything in this game just feels good. I honestly don't know how else to explain it. Even the hiding behind pillars right in front of guards is fun and easily done. Smooth and evenly balanced. I truly adored revelation my first way through always remembering the end and how deeply it hit me, i'd dare call it pretty much equal to arthur morgan's end. Don't come at me! it's a opinion lol, and i can't wait to experience the rest of the series.

The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,Do you feel like video game stories would give tv series a run for their money,"I used to play games out of boredom, never really focused on the detail or anything like that, just liked slashing and shooting but then I played Nier Automata and God damn that story was a masterpiece, before this I only really played COD so I assumed video games were a medium where you’d just turn your brain off and the story wasn’t that important but the gameplay, but man this game changed my perspective of gaming completely and since I’ve already watched most of the highly acclaimed TV series to ever exist - I was always hungry for more amazing stories and I never realised I could find that in gaming

Since then I’ve played a lot of games with fantastic stories, like Outer Wilds, Telltales The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, God of War etc, and man it’s crazy to hear there are so many more games to explore with such deep stories. I’ve ventured into a whole new medium and I’m excited to continue, my question is, how can games pump out such unique stories while most tv series these days are subpar? Are there more good games, than good series?",6,10,1672285798.0
The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,Old game from the 90s that I can't find.,"Like the title says it's a game from the 90s (PC).
It's 2D view from above and I think you were this little jungle man who came in on a raft and then had to cross little patches of land and rivers to get to the other side.

You could like cross rivers by walking on hippos and had to watch out for crocodiles and stuff like that. Or if it was the other way around.

I know it's not very much to go on but if anybody could help out I'd appreciate it alot.

The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,Chloe Price is the real victim of David Madsen’s abusive behavior.,"Honestly, Chloe Price is the real victim of David Madsen’s abusive behavior! He’s physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to Chloe and he basically tries to control her life. He was awful to her in Before the Storm. He demands respect from her saying this “You will respect me and you had enough of a vacation from having a father figure!” What the fuck?! What kind of fucked up asshole says that to a child that lost her dad in a car crash! Chloe had every right to cuss him out! It’s called standing up for yourself! This shows that he has no respect for her or her boundaries! And then he calls her a loser and demands her to apologize to him! Bitch, he should be apologizing to her for that but no he constantly blames her for it and then orders her to empty her pockets, that’s an invasion of privacy. And then he searches her room and doesn’t clean it up for it. What kind of douchebag does that? And then he fucking shows a photo of his dead friend, no I do not like his friend or care about his bullshit story. Having PTSD and losing a friend is not an excuse to abuse children and invade their privacy, I’m glad I had Chloe reject his photograph. But then he verbally abuses her and physically grabs her and threatens her. What kind of asshole does that? Before the Storm does everything in it’s power to try and make us sympathize with David and make Chloe look like a monster. And moving onto Life is Strange 1, He hits Chloe and blames her for “making him do it” this is textbook abuser 101 and a huge level of victim blaming. The way Chloe holds her face after he hits her just shows us that this is not the first time this has happened. He is physically abusive and emotionally manipulative and he doesn’t care about anyone but himself. Let’s not forget that if he was actually doing the fucking job that he was payed to do instead of illegally taking pictures of underage girls and recording his family without permission than Kate wouldn’t have been able to try to kill herself. He was supposed to keep the roof locked so students couldn’t get there but he was too busy victim blaming, taking pictures of, and emotionally abusing a sexual assault victim to do that. The game tries so hard to make me feel bad for him and justify all the terrible things that he did to Chloe but no fucking way. Fuck that guy for using his position of authority to abuse high school girls. The game wants me to feel bad for him getting kicked out of his house? He wouldn’t have if he didn’t record his family without their permission. Fuck that guy. You might think saving Max redeems him. No. Doing one good deed does not make up for 3 years of physically and emotionally abusing Chloe and stalking and harassing high school girls. Then in LIS 2, the child abuser and the man who is partly responsible for Kate's attempted suicide/suicide gets a second attempt at life, while the girl he stalked and helped push her on the roof, dies. I don't even understand why Warren died, while David gets to live. Why are the kids who were innocent die, but an actual child abuser gets to live and have a second attempt at life? Why couldn’t Sacrifice Chloe be Max, Kate and Warren helping Sean and Daniel and Sacrificing Arcadia Bay be Max, Chloe and Kate helping Sean and Daniel? David Madsen should’ve died in the Sacrifice Arcadia Bay. If Chloe was given proper support and avenues to process her grief and given hobbies and activities to keep her occupied she probably never would’ve fallen further into drugs and get into petty crime. It was all rebellion to deal with her lack of support at home. Joyce is not an inherently bad person but she absolutely fucked Chloe over long before her unfortunate demise at Nathan’s hand. Honestly fuck David Madsen. Stop trying to defend David’s actions by making it seem like Chloe deserves to be (literally) pushed around and beaten because she doesn’t respect a man who has no respect for her. Chloe has no reason to respect a misogynistic, abusive asshole; in fact, no one has any reason to. Joyce may be acting in her own defense to placate David, but Chloe isn’t the one who invited an abuser into her home. In the best case, Joyce is an enabler. In the worst (given her gaslighting and emotional manipulation) she’s an active participant. David Madsen is a Grade A Asshole just like Jane from Telltale’s The Walking Dead and Ryan Clayton from Beyond Two Souls and all 3 manipulative assholes deserved each other.",0,32,1658018461.0
The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,Truth about The Last of Us,"I do not think the game is overrated, it deserved the 94-95 metacritic score it got.  But what I do think is that this game is only good because it leans on mainstream content we have ""already"" seen and love.

-Everyone loves Ellen Page, so they put her in the game.  Dont bullshit me saying they are not the same, they act exactly alike and look exactly alike.  The best character in the game doesnt even belong to Naughty Dogs.

-Everyone loves zombie games, so guess what they did?  Made another zombie game for the mainstream mass to love.  I know i love zombie games...

-The Walking Dead game won Game of the year last year...  so guess what Naughty Dogs did?  They pretty much made a refabricated enhanced version of The Walking Dead game w/ almost the exact same story and polt.

Dont get me wrong, I thought the game was a masterpiece, but there is no way in hell its Game of the Year material...  GTA V or Bioshock Infinite will probably take that title.  This game has 0% level of innovation and took absolutely no risk just to make the safest mainstream video game that has ever seen the light of man.

Seriously though, do you guys think another emotional story driven zombie game is going to win GOTY AGAIN...?  I highly doubt The Walking Dead will win GOTY two years in a row.

The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,Good mobile coop and multiplayer games,A very good friend and I met in an mobile war game called Game of thrones conquest. We have also played iron throne and pirates of the Caribbean TOW.  As well as non war games like the walking dead our world and sky children of light. We liked them all for a time. Most of the war games we played ended up having a very toxic environment. We were going to try the new lord of the rings war game however we landed in different serves with no way to team up so that's  a no go.  But we are now looking for games we can play together. We have done the console thing before but it isnt always convenient due to a massive time zone difference. So something we can each also maybe play while the other isnt on. We have sorta hit a wall not knowing where to go next. We like to be social but we do not like drama and toxicity. We want a friendly atmosphere but also challenges and team work. We would greatly appreciate any recommendations. Thanks in advance.,2,0,1634948854.0
The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,Who is Gamings Greatest Protagonist,"Who is Gamings Greatest Protagonist?
For me it’d have to be Arthur Morgan, although it is close between him and Lee Everett from Telltale’s The Walking Dead. What makes Arthur Morgan such an amazing character is the way his morals are challenged. In the start of the game, he’s what you’d call a bad man, killing, robbing, and fighting. But as he gets diagnosed with Tuberculosis he is challenged with death and wants redemption in himself. Doing anything for John and his family so they can make it out alive. Even telling John to run and not look back, John ended up looking back and it’s what got him killed. Anyways who is gamings greatest protagonist in your opinion?",2,21,1625767519.0
The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,"[Howto] Monster Jam Steel Titans 1 ""out of bounds"" glitch.","Had no clue where to post this so I chose here.
This glitch is tested on PC and Switch version of the game. (Not tested in Steel Titans 2).

So, in Monstaer Jam Steel Titans you have these gates that stop you from getting through to new areas. You have to unlock them. When you touch these gates tha game shotgun blasts you back/upwards. Same with going out of bounds.

If you hit these gates at the right angle, it will instead launch you more up and over the gate. Now, it's cool that you get to ""sneak"" into unlocked levels and all but that is NOT the best part of this glitch. You can okay the normal game and just unlock these areas. 

The best part is this glitch DISABLES the ""out of bounds"" check. So you glitch over the gate into locked area, then go to drive out of bounds and the out of bounds warning appears but never blasts you back. You get to explore areas the devs never intended you to see. You can drive so far out and drop into no mans land as well. Visit distant objects or mountains. 

The catch is that if you drive back into areas you do have unlocked, it resets and is back to normal. But to explore areas that are purely for visual background purposes and drive way far out into desert areas is super cool.

The gate I've been using and found best results for is the south gate between Monster Jam University and Gecko Flats Airfield. The one dead center between the 2 in the south. This gate has rock that goes overtop the gate so if you hit it right, it launches you upward and you hit that rock. Causing your truck to shoot off in diff directions, some being OVER that gate. 

Anyways, I discovered it by accident as I smacked into that gate at full speed. I then tried to replicate it and have done it a lot. Its tricky tho. So it will take you a bunch of tries to get it right.

I'll post a video when I get a chance.",2,3,1615568950.0

-thane's final prayer
-thane's eulogy in the dlc

2.) lost odyssey
- the side stories of the main character from over the years. How he touched lives and cared in his own way. 

Never beat the game but really like the story 

3.) walking dead season 1
- the last part of chapter 5.

The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,Death Stranding is trying WAY too hard,"Kojima is most likely a genius of some level, but there's no denying he has a hard time knowing when to reel it in. 

Death Stranding seems like the latest example of him trying to make sense of a bunch of game elements after the fact. 

So we've got Norman Reedus who...walks around. Okay, good start, walking around is pretty standard in games. There's a fantastic looking environment. Also good. Well, it seems a little empty...but okay, it's early on. Okay, now he's carrying a body somewhere that he found...somewhere. This environment looks like it's seen better days, maybe some kind of disaster happened here? Shouldn't there be many more dead people? Well, maybe the dead people got...stranded. Yeah, ""Death Stranding"" right? So Norman Reedus is some sort of clean\-up crew sent to collect dead bodies for \<reasons\>. 

But wait, now there's an invisible ""monster"" with creepy human\-like hands (very Kojima) that seems to be attracted to sound. Oh, boy. Probably one of the most difficult senses to base a monster around since trying to establish what level of sounds will attract it can be vague, at best (see ""A Quiet Place). Norman was clearly trying to control his breath as if merely breathing too loud could attract it, then a women (yes, out of nowhere) surprises him, both audibly gasp and she \*\*says\*\* ""Be Quiet"" and both did not immediately die. Albeit, the ""monster"" did walk toward them, but already I can see this creating some ambiguity in gameplay elements.

Which bring us to...baby battery and flappy light tentacle. This takes things over the top even for Kojima. There are clearly invisible things walking around this world. And the only way to see them is from a loud\-as\-hell ghost flashlight that is powered by a fetus in some artificial womb that Norman Reedus carries on a bandolier around his hip. Even as I type this it feels like I'm just making shit up at this point. He clearly needs to...get somewhere before the ghosties find him (how do they know where he is? Could it be he's yapping away on his radio? Maybe splashing through some muddy water with a berserk tentacle light will make him less noticeable. /s) He gets caught by those ghosties pretty quickly though. 

Let's not forget the dialogue here as well. ""Don't get caught. You'll come back but they won't"" (paraphrasing). So now Norman Reedus is immortal? Or maybe plugged into some world Matrix\-style? Maybe the Land of the Dead/Purgatory? It seems from one 8\-minute trailer we're going to have the level of ridiculousness that the Metal Gear Solid series took a decade to create. 

Honestly, this whole ""game"" seems like a tech demo for some quasi\-related project to come. I'm certainly interested, but come on, Kojima. Tone. It. Down. ",0,14,1528833471.0
The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,What games to play for me?,"Hey guys, I am in a dilemma right now. I am a PC gamer and I have never been the soloplayer, I always needed some kind of competition in my games. Exceptions for this are games that are extremely story driven or have a high focus on sandboxing like Mount&Blade. I mostly enjoy RPGs or strategy games but some shooter elements are cool too. I will just list which games I played so you can maybe recommend me more:

League of Legends (for 4,5 years and I still enjoy it), Diablo 3, DayZ Standalone and Mod (not playing atm, game is too broken imo)

These are the games I have spent most of my time with in the last months. Other games I played:

Metro 2033 and Last Light, Bioshock 1 and 2, Mount and Blade Warband, Walking Dead Season 1 and 2 (maybe my most favourite games ever. I generally don't like adventures, but my love to Walking Dead and the great storytelling sold it for me).

My most anticipated games are No Man's Sky and especially The Division. Everything I hear and see about this game looks just absolutely fantastic. 

I was thinking about buying Civ: Beyond Earth, I had some fun with Civ 4 some years ago. I cannot play games with super great graphics atm because I play on a laptop. I will get a desktop on Christmas. I *could* run Bioshock Infinite on the laptop but I'll wait until I can play it in its full glory next year. Aside from that, I cannot find any games that fit me. Hopefully you can help me!",0,7,1412795863.0
The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,"Jedi Survivor was a great looking, underwhelming, and disappointing game for me","I played the first game a couple years after release on PC and found it to be...fine. I never clicked much with the combat, I did not care for the story, and exploration had it moments but overall felt like a chore. I was struck by how milquetoast the game felt overall. Despite how it borrowed so many mechanics from great games (combat from Dark Souls, exploration from Metroid Prime, platforming like Uncharted) I found the game to not be very exciting, and the main character was positively dull.

So I went into Survivor with pretty low expectations, feeling that I may feel similarly. Early on I was having a good time! I liked the new environments, and the new touches to platforming made that aspect a little more flexible and fluid. The world (especially Koboh) is massive, and gives off a much more impressive sense of scale right away. I still wasn't in love with the combat, but I trudged on, hoping to get to the good stuff.

The longer I got through the game though, the more the shiny newness of the game started to rub off, and my irks with the game came up more and more often.

Likes:

* The visuals and locations are great. Jedha was such a treat to look at and explore from a distance. The weird creatures that you ride and see in the environments were really cool. The graphics and environments were a highlight of the first game, so this comes as no surprise. Clearly this is a strength of the devs. There are of course downsides to the visuals though (see dislikes).
* Sense of scale and variety of locations. I will say that I am slightly bummed that there are fewer smaller worlds, and a bulk of the game is exploring Koboh as you return multiple times. I think I might've preferred to see more weird planets instead of fewer larger worlds. That being said, it is still impressive how much variety there is on Koboh alone. From the Separatist ship, to the swamps, mountain summit, and jungles, it felt like every corner you turned pushed you into new interesting locations.
* The improved platforming gave more variety and flexibility to exploration. It's nice that if you mess up the timing of a wall run, you can simply jump up higher on the wall and start again. The grapple hook was a nice touch as well, and eventually when you get the dash it makes exploring long sections much easier.
* Some abilities and scenes that happen late in the game were very striking and impressive. >!The scene with Darth Vader was very neat. See below for my combat criticisms, but the sequence itself was cool. Seeing him get stronger once he's beaten down and caught on fire was very fitting. When you briefly control Cere (and later when Cal gets angy), the power on display was very fun. This kinda ties into my issues with the combat in general, but being able to mow over enemies in a hit or two was a fun exercise of power. I think Cal most of the time is as boring as can be, but his slide into Dark Side feelings towards the end was a nice touch, a nice reminder of what could be in this story.!<
* The case of characters and NPCs is greatly expanded from the first game. Having a home base that collects the NPCs you come across and seeing it become more lively gives you a location to hang out and return to besides your ship. The voice acting is all pretty great. 

Dislikes:

* I do not like the combat at all. I find it clunky and frustrating. Even though it's clearly inspired by Dark Souls combat, it doesn't have nearly the same depth. The different stances does provide some variety of combat styles, but it still always amounts to the same thing: whittle away at enemies stagger bars, get 1-2 hits in before the stagger bar resets, do it again. For some enemies, do that like 5-6 times until they go down. This became EXTREMELY tedious for me, and I quickly grew tired of it. You have LIGHTSABERS. It should not take that many hits to down an enemy. It feels more like you're waving around cardboard tubes. It doesn't help that the combat does not feel good to me at all, especially when there are alot of enemies attacking at once and you are constantly being interrupted before you can hit someone. Look, I played Sekiro, all the souls games, the god of war games, etc. I am not new to this style of combat or difficult fights. But these fights felt frustrating due to the clunkiness and feel of the combat itself. It just isn't for me personally.
* The boss fights. The bosses in this game, especially the optional boss monsters, are absymal. The boss monsters first: they have 1-hit KO attacks that are nearly impossible to avoid. The spawn of Odgo Dogdo (sp?) and the Rancor fights were absolutely miserable. After attempting them 20 times on Normal difficulty without getting anywhere, I was forced to turn the difficulty down to Story just to get through them. Don't even get me started on the Force Tear fights!! I have no idea what they were thinking. Any playtest should show how miserable these fights are. I love difficulty in games, but when it's done right. These fights don't feel satisfying to beat, the difficulty and frustration comes from cheap instant deaths and long health bars. I also did not particularly enjoy the regulary boss fights. It took me roughly 30 tries to beat >!Vader!<, and maybe a dozen to beat the final boss. Did NOT enjoy the combat whatsoever, and it really showed its ugly head in the boss fights.
* I don't care for any of the characters. I did not care about Bode from the start, he felt like a boring buddy cop that I was forced to hang out with. Whenever I did my rounds talking to companions I avoided talking to him because he was just so uninteresting to me. The main hub was a Mass Effect-esque location where you could continue conversations with your NPC buddies. I love this idea in theory. The problem for me was I just did not find these characters interesting or fun to talk to. I felt very similarly to Horizon Forbidden West. Both games seemed to add this feature from games like Mass Effect, but they missed the part of actually making them interesting. 
* The story was a nothing-burger for me. It has a similar MacGuffin type quest like the first game. We need to find the mystical... location... that we've heard tales about. This MacGuffin Land will be our escape from the empire. Nothing interesting happens in the story. You are on the heels of bandits who are seeking for the same thing. Along the way you free an emo ex-Jedi with one arm who is Evil\_TM and fights you before escaping and allying with said bandits. You see flashbacks of people talking to this dude, and they elaborate that... he is evil and they don't want him to be. Man alive, for a galaxy with magic and exotic locations and interesting history, I was falling asleep watching the main cutscenes.>!The big emotional turning point in the story is when Bode betrays the group and steals your key to the Super Land and escapes. Cere dies. I can't tell you how little I cared about these turn of events. !<Ultimately very disappointed in the storytelling.
* This game made me feel the weight of modern AAA action adventure type of gameplay. You explore infinite nooks and crannies of a massive world to find goodies, collectibles, and memories scattered about. What do you find in your hours of searching? Cosmetic items with no benefit. Memories of someone who died, and says literally nothing interesting that adds to the worldbuilding. More cosmetic items. A memory of a Gregarious Jedi who says ""I don't think I can make it through this challenge.."" in the easiest challenge in the world. Shards and datadiscs where you can go and...buy more cosmetic items. I truly feel that modern games need to overhaul and reinvent what exploration means in a video game. It feels like they created a huge world just to add 2,000 unremarkable collectibles and activities within it. You do occasionally find useful mechanical upgrades like perk points and stim upgrades, but these are fewer and further between. The issue for me is that this is an established formulaic game structure that is being rehashed with items and ""things to do"", instead of them building out interesting ideas and building a world around them.

The Star Wars world is such a rich vein to pull from. And from that rich vein in this case, unfortunately, is a formulaic open world styled game with mediocre combat, and a lackluster story. It's beautiful and interesting to look at and explore what might be, but when you end up finding is disappointing and trivial. When I got to the final area of the game, >!I immediately ran across a dead High Republic soldier. This touched on my imagination as I suddenly wondered what this ancient soldier's story was, and what this story could have been like it it tapped into Star War's interesting history and lore. Instead, I continued to walk forward and met with Bode as he stood in an empty chamber in an empty world, because the Plot demanded that this random forsaken place was more important to these characters than the ideals that the High Republic may have stood for.!< If this game took more from games like KOTOR, it would have been better. Instead it took more from the Generic\_AAA\_Formula and felt more like other games in its wake than a unique experience.",0,40,1708811920.0

Mine are The Wolf Among Us, What Remains Of Edith Finch and Firewatch! I think that they are all amazing and everyone should try them. They are probably very cheap as well.

**REMEMBER, this IS meant to be an ALL TIME 100 Greatest, ANY GENRE OF GAME IS OK, any system is fine!!**

--Shocked to see NO handheld games!@@--

I will take pics and blog about it, hell even a video or two thrown in there.  I need something to do with my spare time, and breeding pokemon just is not cutting it.  I will start this weekend with the ones I own, it looks like Metroid for NES is up first (with no walk through and a wife who will hopefully draw me a map!) **Hell, if I can mange to I will stream it.**

Here is what needs to happen:

1) I need your help compiling a list of 100 games to beat before dying (if its a non beatable game like an mmo or something then i have to achieve SOMETHING in it, like max lvl, raid, whatever).

2) I will then see if I have access to that game in its original form, if I do not I will be looking around or asking for donations.

3) I will beat said game IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM, no emulators, no cheating, NO WALKTHROUGHS, non of that baloney.

4) I will blog and post pics for you all to enjoy.


That is the extent of it.  I do not know of a way to make a user submitted poll unfortently, so if anyone knows of a way that would help kick this off immensely. 

**Edit 3:**

Did not know G4 or someone was doing the same thing right now, but F*** them this is for me as its on my bucket list and will be cool to show to everyone!

The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is good, just not Game of the Year good.","*Disclaimer:* I think Red Dead Redemption 2 is a good game, which I am enjoying, but it isn't \*that\* good.

(Btw this may contain game spoilers so if you do read, be prepared)

So I bought RDR2 for myself for Christmas. Mainly because of the Online as my friend had also gotten it for Christmas and we thought ""being a cowboy sounds fun"" and after the amount of time we'd put into GTA Online, we figured it would be pretty similar. But despite my gripes with the multiplayer, let's talk about the Story Mode for a second.

The story is good. I'm enjoying it. I'm invested in it. It's one of the more interesting singleplayer games that I've played. However, I don't think it deserved Game of the Year (that's not me saying that Fortnite did, so calm down

I watched a video by NakeyJakey which was really interesting. In the video, he expresses his frustrations with an open world game being so linear. Everything is so forced no matter what you did. And then I played, and I couldn't agree more.

Your camp: Your *family*. The people that are supposed to have your back. In fact, they have your back so much that no matter how little you do, how little money you add to the funds, it doesn't matter. Because the story must progress. Couldn't be something interesting where if your relationship with the camp is too low, you have to raise it before they will let you do missions etc. And the interactions with them are so disappointing. ""Howdy"" ... ""Glad to be out of those mountains"" ... ""Well I won't keep ya""

Like really? That's the best character interaction you could come up with? 1 hello, 1 relevant voice line and then goodbye.

Random interactions: Some random interactions are interesting. A couple of homeless people, the 1 in Valentine and the one in Rhodes. Both play out very similar but still interesting nonetheless. It's a shame the homeless guy in Valentine doesn't ruin the bank robbery.

And there's also no relationship between you and the characters. Nothing to build. Nothing to work on. Nothing to pursue. Let me ask Charles to go hunting with me. Let me ask Hosea and Dutch to go fishing so I can catch that legendary fish and give it to the famous fisherman. Don't give me an option once every blue moon when the option is available. And let's not mention how useless the camp is for getting resources and funds.

As I said, some random interactions are interesting. Like finding the beheaded bodies and getting the map pieces. I'm looking forward to finishing that. (Please don't spoil it. That'd be appreciated)

But I swear if I have to walk past that guy searching for Gavin without giving the option to help or get some clues I'm going to blow his brains out. I get that I'm probably supposed to just find him but some sort of clue from his shouting mate would be useful.

Linear completion: The game is very linear. Which is kinda disappointing. The best example I have would be at the very start of the game, in the mountains, when you rob the train. Let the player choose how to wire the dynamite. Let the player be the deciding factor in if the tracks blow up or not. Give me the choice to fuck it up, or make it work smoothly. Or the Valentine bank robbery. Give me the opportunity to just walk away. Don't force me to have a shootout with the whole town for the sake of it. It's boring.

*SORT OF A SPOILER*

>!During a random night in Rhodes, walking by the gun store, I get stopped by a man in the basement asking for help. And how do you free said man? Well, there's only one logical solution. Point your gun at the store owner. Even though Dutch specifically asked you not to use guns in the area of Rhodes, I can let that slide. But, you mean to tell me the gun store owner doesn't have a key to let the trapped guy go free? I really do have to shoot the chain to set him free? I'm surprised I didn't get a wanted level because despite being hidden, people still know it was you committing the crime.!<

*SPOILER*

>!Or when Colm and Dutch meet. At least give me the chance to hear the guy sneaking up behind me. Or at the very least, show the same rifle I take off my horse in the cutscene instead of your predetermined choice.!<

*SPOILER*

>!When I walk into Rhodes, give me the chance to save Sean's life by somehow not just walking down the street. Give me some sort of freedom with the game.!<

Committing crimes: Committing crimes is weird. You can wear a face mask, and people still know it was Arthur Morgan, unless you use the full mask, which doesn't really make much sense. I mean if it doesn't stop people from recognising you, why even put it in the game?

Basically, what I'm trying to say is Rockstar have made a very good story for the game, but it could have been so much better.",2,50,1546357937.0
The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,Looking for a game-,"Hey! I'm looking for a game similar to Elite Dangerous and Star Citizen (Tho starcitizen's not out yet so I need an alternative)

Elite is great but the planets are barren and there's nothing on them, plus you can't walk outside your ship and stuff and that kinda sucks. No mans sky is great too but I don't really like how it looks, it looks like fortnite went to space.",2,6,1556474670.0

**If you see anything missing, input is greatly appreciated**

**Woflox** Found [an Amazing Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic6dKnv3WdU) showcasing many things, like UI, shouts, combat, spells, lotsa stuff!
**Madalienmonk** provided a [Link](http://www.gameinformer.com/p/esv.aspx) to some good info. check it out!

**Game Mechanics**

* You can Dual wield any weapon and spell, in other words: 2 spells, 2 weapons, 1 spell-1 weapon

* Third Person has been overhauled; looks and feels better.

* HUNDREDS of hours of playtime, 30 hour main quest

* Snow accumulates dynamically.    *yes, you read that correctly*

* Dragons are not scripted.

* Economy will be better developed

* You can walk away from conversations and walk with NPCs while in dialogue

* instant traveling is still possible, Morrowind type travel also confirmed.

* there are random events

* Killing a shop owner will result in a family member taking his place. the new owner is aware of your murder.

* Very likely that spell-making has been removed, though this is still under speculation.

* There are companions and the system has been overhauled. 

* NPCs will interact with each other. You can see foxes hunt down rabbits and other such events.

**NPCs**

* NPC's will change their disposition to you based on your actions. (don't go killing their family)

* children will be featured in Skyrim

* NPC's perform Daily chores. They will cut wood, gather grain and the like. they have building for these chores; 
wood mills and wind mills. 

* when you drop an item, NPC's will fight for it or ask if you still want that item and pick it up. value probably plays some part in this.

**Leveling**

* All skills affect leveling, Higher skills boosts affect your leveling or ""experience"" more, therefore leveling a skill level from 89 to 90 would affect your experience more than leveling a skill from 39 to 40

* There are perks, Like in the Fallout 3 series, some perks can be upgraded(tree style)

* you can level to much higher levels, leveling is faster. Skyrim's rate of leveling is roughly double that of oblivion's, this is due to the perk system. leveling above 50 is possible, but much harder.

* Level Scaling is still used but some areas won't be scaled, much like Fallout 3.

**Perks, Skills and Attributes**

* There are only three attributes: Health, Magicka and Stamina

* The speech skill has been simplified, The persuasion wheel has been removed.

* Stealth has changed somewhat. Enemies have different states of alertness and do not switch between them 
as abruptly as in oblivion.

* Known skills available in this game: Speechcraft, Alchemy, Conjuration, Destruction, Restoration, Alteration, Enchanting, Smithing, Heavy Armor, Block, Two Handed, One Handed, Archery, Light Armor, Sneak -- Hand to hand is currently under speculation.

* Confirmed Block Perks:  Shield Wall, Deadly Bash, Power Bash, Bash Disarm, Shield Charge, Deflect Arrows, Elemental Protection, Quick Reflexes.

* There are crafting skills: Woodcutting, Smithing, Enchanting, Cooking, Mining

**Character Creation**

* Players can only choose their Race, Gender and their Appearance  

* There will be ten playable races

* Faces look MUCH better

* Birthsigns have been removed.


**Combat and Spells**

* Finishing moves are part of combat.

* Spells now come in the AOE variety

* friendly fire(slashing?) is less possible due to a magnetism mechanic.

* There are ""shouts"", that work like unique spells. 24 of them.

* Archers can hold their breath for accuracy.

* you cannot move while pulling an arrow.

**Game World**

* Five large cities;larger than oblivion's. cities are inside walls (separate world). all cities have different architecture to reflect their history.

* 15 smaller villages; hamlets.

* Dragon's attack cities

* 150+ dungeons

* mounts confirmed:horses confirmed

* first city is named Riverwood, another is named Haarfingar( a trading port)

* Land Types include : snowy mountains, grassy tundras, pine forests, fall forest, glacial areas and volcanic 
tundras. 

* There are taverns in which you may pick up rumours and quests

**Creatures**

*Hostile*

* Dragons

* Undead (variety of skeletons, zombies. Not sure if [Draugr](http://i.imgur.com/4TY8b.jpg) constitute all of types of undead)

* Trolls

* Spiders

* ice wraiths

* wolves

* sabre tooths... awesome

* serpents


*non-hostile*

* Giants

* mammoths

* Elk

* deer

* Rabbits

* Foxes

* there are supposedly an assortment of game creatures. .


**Items**

* Uniques weapons are available. unique weapon effects are hidden until wielded.

**Construction Set**

* There is a Construction Set, That's pretty much all we know about it so far.

**UI**

* [Picture of skill menu](http://i.imgur.com/MszCV.jpg)

* check out woflox's vid up top


**Thing we don't know or are unsure of**

The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,Who are your top 3 favorite female protagonists?,"  

I don’t play across a variety of consoles or PC when it comes to gaming but I have still come across several female main characters that were so good I started to wonder which ones were my favorites. I compiled a list of my top 3 favorite female protagonists in video games and came up with the following list in no particular order. I landed on these specific characters for multiple different reasons, whether it was the enjoyment of playing with them, their particular personality/character development, or really caring about their story. Since I haven’t been able to play on PC, Nintendo, or PS4 I’m interested to hear from you guys because I know there are some other really great characters out there!

Senua – Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice – I work in the mental health field, so of course this one was a bit more personal for me. She is an absolute bad ass and I don’t think my gaming skills were ever quite as sharp as when I was playing with her and tearing through enemies. The game was beautiful and playing with headphones really led to a truly immersive experience. 

Kassandra - assassin's creed odyssey – a similar character in the sense that I felt powerful, enjoyed killing enemies, and threw out the typical female stereotype. I’ve noticed in other games when playing as a male, I would try sleeping around with other characters (ie. Commander Shepard) just to get some kicks out of it. I took the opportunity with Kassandra to play as we powerful woman who has no issue getting her’s along the way. She’s a beast and a deadly assassin, what can I say. 

Clementine – Telltale’s Walking Dead – Great character development from the very beginning as she is a young, innocent, and scared child to the point of being a leader making tough decisions of life or death. Takes some time, but playing throughout the seasons has really been cool to see how she has grown and come into her own.

Honorable mentions:

YoRHa No.2 Type B (2B) – Neir: Automata – I guess not technically female since android and all, but still. 

Ciri – Witcher 3 – obviously not the main character of the game but still a major part and you’re given the opportunity to play as her during the main storyline. 

Aurora – Child of Light

Lightning - FFXIII",10,11,1604076463.0

The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,Help me finds games/ my genre of games,"So recently I have been playing a lot of games due to my recent move close to a library that's only a 20 minute walk, it has basically every game that is out and if it doesn't they can call another library that does have it and bring it to them for you to grab after a day or two, I have been playing a lot of games and have fallen in love with gaming yet again, but I have experienced a problem with my games, I have become extremely picky towards games thanks to the basic unlimited selection of games that I have.

I have played multiple games and so far the three I adore the most are very cinematic based games I guess I could call them? 
I'm talking red dead redemption 2, ghost of Tsushima, and ik I'll get some hate for this but the last of us 2, I think it gets a little more hate then it deserves but I loved it, I really enjoy games with beautiful graphics and open worlds, I enjoy really becoming the character that I'm assigned as, I loved becoming Arthur Morgan and going from a troubled man with the law to a man who truly wanted to change, I love becoming Jin Sakai and seeing the internal conflict with his two beliefs of survival and honor, and I loved becoming both Abby and Ellie seeing how they were both the enemies of each others stories and the result of the situations they were in, I loved death stranding, all of the Life is Strange games, falling in love with the two brothers specifically cuz I'm a Hispanic male who has experienced negative stigma from my color and I loved shadow of Mordor with their amazing friend or foe system of betrayal and gaining trust, the characters felt SO real and man was it great

With all of those games tho came a confusion of having no clue what I want genre wise, how can I capture the feeling I had with those games? What games am I even into? What genre? Are they action RPGs? Open worlds RPGs? I genuinely have no clue, could you guys help me out? I don't even know if I am in the right subreddit but I need to find more amazing games on ps4 that hold so much story and beauty",1,4,1640143005.0
The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,Legacy of Kain's humans vs vampires issue,"    
I enjoy *Legacy of Kain*'s twists, themes about free will vs fate, and the idea of what it truly means to do the right thing. However,  something that always bugged me about this series is the stance it took with vampires and humans fighting.

  
In vampire media, you often run into an issue where the ethics of humans killing vampires comes up.  Hunting vampires is often written as guilt-free extermination on the part of humanity, even if the possibility of good vampires comes up, or humans hunting vampires is framed as genocide, and the fact that humans have good reason to fear or despise creatures who see them is food is glossed over. *Legacy of Kain* falls into the latter camp.

  
In the original game, *Blood Omen*, after the protagonist Kain goes through time to stop the evil army of the Nemesis from rampaging across the world, destroying all its path, he learns that his changes to history led to a genocide of vampires. The game acts like this is worse than the army of the Nemesis destroying all in its path.

  
I hate to be the guy who asks why genocide is a bad thing, but why is this worse? As ugly a picture as we get of humanity, the vampires aren’t any better. The only one we meet besides Kain, Vorador, is a hedonist who fancies vampires as gods and sees humans as food, with no hints other vampires see humans as other than food as well. Vorardo only advocates against meddling in human affairs for pragmatic reasons since the last vampires got too aggressive, the humans nearly exterminated them.  
Kain himself doesn’t help the case of the vampires in the game’s canon ending when between the choice to sacrifice himself to restore the Pillars of Nosgoth to prevent the rot of the land or stay alive, he chooses to stay alive and takes the  view humans are cattle. So yeah, really good case for why humans should not try to wipe out the vampires.

  
By the next game, *Soul Reaver*, Kain has conquered the world and established an empire ruled by vampires where humans are livestock. Our new protagonist, Raziel, is out to destroy Kain and his empire for most of the game. In the original ending, he succeeded, with his only concern being that his benefactor, the Elder God, might be the true evil.

  
*Soul Reaver 2* sees Raziel question the ethics of exterminating vampires who weren’t unchallenged predators in the past. Eventually, we get a reason why killing vampires is a bad thing with the reveal their deaths will break a seal holding back a race of monsters called the Hylden that vampires imprisoned in another dimension. With each dead vampire, The Binding keeping the Hylden from entering the universe grows weaker.

  
It is only the black sheep of the series *Blood Omen 2* where anybody brings up that humans have good reason to hate and fear creatures who feed on them to survive.

  
Adding to this, I have seen it brought up that the  MCU has a trend where people who bring up issues with the world’s status quo are villains. I won’t comment on that here, but if that does bother you, then I must say *Legacy of Kain* has an even worse case of it.

  
Moebius, the human architect of vampire extermination throughout the series, unlike the MCU villains who bring up problems with our world, isn’t presented as a man who makes a point about how badly vampires treat humans. He is simply written as a cruel, manipulative man who wants vampires gone at any cost, and the fact that vampires kidnapped him as a boy isn’t even brought up as a point of sympathy.

  
Likewise, the Sarafan, an army built to fight the vampires, is not written as a group of people with legitimate concerns about fighting beings who see humans as food. Instead, they are written as sadists who are as bad as the vampires and seek to rule the world themselves.

  
This arrangement comes off as unintentionally pro-authoritarian with the implication that the vampires have a blank check to do whatever they please thanks to the threat of the Hylden.

  
In the final game, *Defiance*, the audience learns that the vampires were the aggressors in the war with the Hylden thanks to the manipulations of the Elder God, telling the audience the conflict wasn't as black and white as previously thought. *Defiance* didn't sell well enough for another sequel to be greenlit, so sadly, the plans to elaborate on this sympathetic angle of the Hylden never made it to the drawing board. How the conflict would have been resolved is up in the air.

  
Along with conflict with the Hylden, the series still had the underlying issue with humans and vampires. The Hylden became a  threat because the Binding keeping them imprisoned got weakened by humans killing vampires. We have a couple of moments where it is brought up that it is understandable for humans to hate and fear vampires. However, as the series stands, we are left with an unfair arrangement where vampires are meant to rule over humanity, and humans are not to oppose them.

  
Does anybody have any thoughts on how the human/vampire clashes could have been solved without giving the undertone that humans are supposed to accept that they are of inferior status to vampires? The series creators did decide to show that the conflict between vampires and Hylden wasn't as black and white as initially believed in the final entry and had plans to expand on it in the future. Does anybody think this would have room for the series to cut humanity a break?",0,29,1706217161.0
The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,Would you recommend Elden ring to someone who prefers multiplayer games?,"I Never played a dark souls game, I tried bloodborne for maybe 10 minutes and dropped it. (Can’t remember why exactly, was years ago)

I’m mainly a multiplayer gamer who doesn’t have all day time to play games so I love to just jump into quick multiplayer pvp games. This does not mean that I don’t enjoy single player games. The problem is that I actually don’t have a favorite genre. If I list my favorite single player games, there is not really a pattern where I can tell “I enjoy these kind of single player games”. But I do think that I really enjoy a good story. (Single players I liked were something like: walking dead telltale, Ori and the will of the wisps, the last of us, Spider-Man ps4,firewatch, Diablo 3, borderlands)

I do love challenges and hard games but I don’t really like to invest a lot of time reading all kinds of items and figure out what exactly I should do with them. (I have nothing against looting but I get quickly overwhelmed when there are just too many items).",0,4,1671150591.0
The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,Let's talk about games with a rural setting!,"Hi Guys!

&#x200B;

Lately, I have noticed that I started to grow more and more fond of games with a rural setting. This is especially true for games that are set in rural US, as this part of the world is very much underrepresented in gaming.

&#x200B;

Recommend me some games to play and look at, and I will tell you what I consider great in this sub-genre.

&#x200B;

Currently Playing - **Far Cry 5**

I have to say, I could not care less about the Far Cry series. It's your run-of-the-mill shooter. I've been gaming for a long time and they do absolutely nothing for me. Especially 3-4, the tropical/jungle setting does nothing for me and I know Ubisoft: they have a tested gameplay loop that you repeat for 20-30ish hours. (this keeps me away from modern AC games, I know I would like the setting of Odyssey, but can't stomach the gameplay loop for 30 hours).

However Far Cry 5 came along and it had a modern, rural US setting. Immediately it intrigued me, but of course, no way I'm buying at full price. Picked it up for $20, got exactly what I expected. A beautiful game world, a mediocre story, and tested gameplay. The world is so nicely built that it will alone keep me playing. 

Honestly, the game itself is a little bit irritating with action turned up to 100. They have built this amazing game world where you can't find one minute of silence or peace. Regardless, really impressed with the gameplay area in FC5 and I love discovering farmhouses, going into hunting lodges, and scaling the mountains.

&#x200B;

The King - **Red Dead Redemption 2**

Apart from delivering one of the best and most emotional stories in modern gaming, RDR2 has one of the best game worlds. Sure it takes place around 1900ish so everything is mostly rural by default.

Regardless, I loved to take it slow in that game. Whatever rockstar did for the RDR2 map is a great achievement in gaming. If you want, you can ride your horse around quickly, help strangers, get into fistfights etc. However, if you want to take it slow, you can travel the roads of RDR2 in peace and quiet, taking in the scenery and wondering what life was like back then.

Absolutely amazing game, I think currently unmatched by any other game for a singleplayer experience (yes Chapter 4-5 was a little 'slow', but first few chapters and especially the last one makes up for everything)

Would love a game with RDR2 emotional story style that takes place in '80s rural US.

&#x200B;

Narrative Gem - **Firewatch**

Considering its 2016 release, Firewatch is quite old today. I think for me this was the first game that could really take me out of all the usual settings we have in gaming: warzones, big cities, alien planets etc.

Although in reality, it's a walking simulator, the devs did a great job with the story to keep you on your toes, and they have built a beautiful national park for you to explore. 

&#x200B;

What are your thoughts? What are some good games that explore rural parts of the world? An open-world is always a plus. Looking for something nice after I finish FC5.

&#x200B;

Yes, I've tried farming simulator, but it's a little too slow for my taste. 

**Generation Zero** looks cool, but reviews say it gets boring quickly. I love the **Fallout** games, especially think that 4 has the best setting. It might not be the best RPG of them all, but setting-wise 4 takes the cake for me. **No Man's Sky** is not bad, and sometimes I take it for a spin, but no matter how many updates they add, it does seem like the planets look the same always. Sure there are biomes and such, but exploring for 2-3 hours and you have seen it all.",12,16,1622208824.0
The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,Licensed games that would make bank,"I recently got to thinking what I would want to do if I actually had my own game-studio and actual experience. I quickly understood that I'll never get there and as a filmmaker I'm certainly not qualified to make a game. But I had some ideas to revive the trend of licensed games in a positive way.

Let me know what you'd think of these

***Scorpion: A Mortal Kombat Legend -***   
Very much inspired by the original God of War games in it's gameplay we follow Hanzo Hashashi in a past Japan through his rise within the Shirai Ryu and meeting his wife. While the game takes a linear mission structure we get to explore the open world much like in the original 'Assassin's Creed'.  
The first half of the game ends with a boss fight against Sub-Zero that sees the hero fall at the villains hands.  
We then explore a semi-open world Nether Realm and make our way as Quan-Chi's henchman.  
The game ends during the first MK game with defeating Bi-Han.  
Hanzo still gets to return to Japan to explore more locations & secrets, only now his old home-base is burnt down and destroyed.  
With collectibles to find, MK side characters to meet and a long main-quest this is MK the way we've never seen it before.

***Shadow of Middle-Earth -***   
1000 years after the War for the Ring Talion is mysteriously ressurected and makes his way through Middle-Earth finding out why he was ressurected (to defeat Morgoth).  
We get to explore an open world Middle-Earth with friendly NPCs and the familiar Nemesis System. This time with humans & orcs.

***Resident Evil: Racoon City -***   
An open world action-adventure in the vein of ""Dead Island"", we get to explore the open city of Racoon City for the first time and can clear out as many districts as possible.  
The story follows a Barry Burton as he escapes the city and attempts to save as many NPCs in his home-base as possible (much like in ""Dead Risisng"") until he has to make his & his groups daring escape out of the town before it is nuked by Umbrella.",0,7,1689772024.0
The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,Graphics are as good as they need to be. At least for now.,"I'd love it if they could make games prettier AND play better at the same time but they are clearly not capable of it. Graphics get better all the time but AI and world building seems to have been the same for about 10 years if not more.

As Ray Tracing is starting to prove graphics are into diminishing returns. They can make the graphics as perfect as they want but you are constantly reminded that you are playing a game in other areas. Ray Tracing is an impressive technological feat but it isn't exactly reinventing the wheel. Shadows didn't look particularly bad to start with.

But with non graphical aspects of games you are constantly dragged out of the immersion.

In Fallout 4 when you wake up from the Cryo chamber you walk through the vault and see the huge gun on the wall in the overseer's office and you character says something like ""I'll come back for you later.""..........why did they say that? At that moment in the game they had no idea that the world was dead. They saw a nuke go off and then they woke up in a confused state. They saw their baby taken and spouse shot but they didn't know there were Super Mutants walking around or that it had been 200 years since they entered the Vault. They wouldn't have automatically wanted to grab the huge gun off the wall.

I was playing Monster Hunter World recently and in the start when you see the dinosaur things from the previous games and the lady says ""Hey they are as docile here as they are back home."" or something to that effect. It just so happened that at this moment I was standing in the stream with one of these things walking towards me. I thought man it would be so cool if it stopped and curiously sniffed me at that moment. It was about level with my character's head and it would have been such a charming little detail. But no obviously it just clipped straight through me like a brain dead zombie.

It looks great but it ACTS dumb! I want it to look great and act realistic.

Graphics are fine, they are great even, just give them a rest and put your attention somewhere else for a change!",3,9,1553353549.0
The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,PS4 and Switch Game Recommendations,"Hello! I’ve never been super into gaming as I wasn’t allowed to play video games when I was younger aside from the Wii. I have had a PS4 for a few years and gotten a switch last year. I wold love for some game recommendations. I’m a huge fan of story based games like TLOU and Uncharted. I also love decisions based games like Until Dawn and Detroit become human. I’m also a big fan of horror games in general like The Dark Pictures anthology and Little Nightmares. Do you guys have any game recommendations? There’s a lot of horror games on the Switch I’ve seen but I’m not sure what’s good. Sometimes they seem like they end up being like stupid low quality phone games. 

Games I’ve already played are…
TLOU, Uncharted, Detroit Become Human, GTA, Beyond Two Souls, Man of Medan, Little Hope, House of Ashes, Little Nightmares

Games I own but have yet to play are…
The Walking Dead (I have the first on PS4 but I’m debating buying them all for Switch bc I like the switch better), Heavy Rain, Alien Isolation, Limbo, Dead by Daylight, Mortal Kombat 11, Bloodborne

I think that’s everything lol. Please let me know if you have any recommendations or tell me which of these I should play next!",1,6,1639588532.0
The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,Never mind the dialogue: Forspoken has the worst controls I've ever seen.,"This is spoiler-free, but I do mention the opening scene of the game.

- Target lock randomly decides to just cancel. If you're running, the camera will shoot behind you and you lose sight of the enemies. The enemies can be difficult to see against the background (many have similae colours to the landscape), which makes this MUCH worse because you then have to aim by hand. Even just locking back on to the same target is a nightmare because you need to look at them, and that means you can't be in parkour.

- You can't move the camera in parkour. It either moves automatically, or it locks in to the target lock. Good luck knowing which one it'll be ahead of time!

- There's a dead zone on the joystick, which isn't unusual at all, except that it's a rather large deadzone. This means pushing the joystick far enough to only move it a little is a... massive pain. Which makes actually aiming a nightmare. The camera is both too fast and too slow - it's too slow when you want to turn quickly, way too fast when you want to make microadjustments.

- There is absolutely no way to customise this deadzone.

- There is also no way to set the camera behind you manually (most games use R3). Auto movement through parkour is slow and takes forever to get behind you - it just kinda drifts over somewhat.

- If you're talking, excluding quips and banter between the main character and her companion, 99% of the time, you're not moving. Your character cannot for the life of her walk and talk. She comes to a complete stop for the *entire conversation*.

- When the conversation ends, the visual cues go away, and you're playing the game again? Haha, psych! No you're not! Give it another 5 seconds. Everything takes 5-6 seconds. Whether it's opening a door or any other small action, it's a chunk of time for the very slow animation to play out, during which time you're just kinda... watching. This sluggishness penetrates every facet of the game, too. If two characters are speaking in a cutscene, there's a very long gap between lines of dialogue - even two lines from the same person. It's like whoever did the audio just added 3-6 seconds in after every single line, just because. Silence is half the content of the conversations. The characters even speak slowly, which just makes it worse.

- Neverending talking. I don't mean the dialogue banter. I'm talking about story. Okay, the beginning of the game likes to stop you every 5 seconds for another useless short cinematic, sure, but I'm talking about story points where you need to talk to X to advance the plot. So instead of getting that option, you're told to... look around the room. Literally, inspect everything. Cat food, books, whatever. So your character can toss out random quips that add nothing to the story. And yes, you need to interact with everything in the room in order to continue in the story. At the start of the game, you're in a courtroom in front of a very... morally questionable judge, who tells you to look at your previous encounters with the law. This is the first scene of the entire game. The three documents on the table are... your high school diploma (not a run-in with the law), some personal stuff (no legal connections), and the arrest report for the reason she's in court right now. None of these things are ""previous encounters,"" and she has some pointless quip to say for each one. If you pick the diploma, she'll say ""haven't seen that in awhile."" It's not the words themselves I'm complaining about here, it's their presence in the game at all. Many games have bloat lore, voicelines, trash quests, all to puff up the time. This game takes the bloat interactive items, lore, voicelines, everything, shoves them all down your throat, demanding you check each and every one before moving on with the story, all the while stopping you and refusing to even let you move around in the meantime.

- Not controls-related, but these tutorials need to die. I don't need the game to explain to me what "" ""experience"" is. I don't need three separate tutorials about rest spots, followed by a character comment about ""an actual bed"" on her fourth rest stop. Like okay, I get it. I got it. Fucking drop it already. Just let me play.

- Stealing the camera to give me a tutorial about something entirely unrelated to combat *during combat*.

- You need to stop moving entirely to do many things in this world. Stopping takes about 3-5 seconds to do (see my earlier note on always standing still while doing anything).

- Walking is terrible. Changing direction, picking up speed, it's the very definition of sluggish. Even while in parkour, it is VERY essy to hit a door frame or clip something minor.

- Too many things open the menu to take you to the lore page. If you find something new, it'll pause the game to bring you to the lore. The next time you open the menu, it'll be on the lore page. This page is not central, by the way, it's off to the right, which is annoying because if my page is being auto-changed to anything, I'd much rather it be in the middle.

- The controls frequently decide to just... not respond.

- The game is 40% pressing or holding O, 40% mashing R2, and 20% using the right joystick because you can't see anything.

- There are certain actions you can do, like an extra long dodge while charging a spell, that just do not work 50% of the time.

- You're in a tight space and pushing forward on L? Okay, we're gonna take you for a spin. Enjoy! Oh, you wanted to go forward? Uh... which way is that again?

- There are honestly just too many things to mention. Using the controls is mostly comprised of waiting for the protagonist to relax her shoulders or whatever so I can move again.

I can live with terrible dialogue. I'm a writer, and loads of games have bad writing. I'm used to it, it's not a dealbreaker. It's not the dialogue, it's the controls that make it unbearable.

Sorry if something in this post randomly stops making sense. I'm a little tired and my phone is not cooperating, so it took me 5 minutes to type that last paragraph.

Edit: Added some more stuff because seriously, there's just no end to it.",142,96,1674634825.0
The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,Greatest Games of the Decade,"Hey all! Inspired by flicks and their rankings that have been looking back at the decade's best films, I thought it might be fun to look back at the best games of each year of the decade :) This is my list! Love to see some of your guys'

**2010: Mass Effect 2**

That final mission. It's the first time, and one of the only times, that I felt as though every action I undertook in the game was leading up to this inevitable moment. That all the relationships I had formed, that all the quests I had completed, actually mattered. It was pure video gaming magic. Bioware might never have quite reached those heights again, but damn I'm glad they did once.

**Runners Up: Assassin's Creed 2, Bioshock 2, Halo: Reach**

**2011: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim**

I still remember the first time I walked into Markarth. This huge tower rises up above narrow streets and stone walls, swampy and muddy as opposed to the rest of the country that stood caked in snow and ice. Skyrim, even today, is a huge game: with lush, green valleys and rolling hills, mountains buried under snow and tunnels and dungeons snaking beneath it all. Skyrim had more ""wow"" moments per square inch than most games had in their entire world.

**Runners Up: Portal 2, Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, Dragon Age 2**

**2012: Borderlands 2**

I was a bit grouchy about this game when it came out. I loved *Borderlands*, it's cell shaded graphic style was absolutely one of the most refreshing things to come to a shooter in a long time, and *Borderlands 2,* to me, cleaned the edges up a little too much for my taste. So, it was a long time before I played it. . . but when I did, man. For one thing the art style was maintained much more than I originally thought, and the first time walking into Sanctuary was just a little bit of magic.

**Runners Up: Mass Effect 3, Halo 4, The Walking Dead Season One**

**2013: The Last of Us**

I don't think I can write anything about The Last of Us that hasn't been written already, so I don't even think I should try. This game revolutionized video game storytelling in a way that no other game has. It completely reinvented the wheel as to what games can be and should be. It is the true swan song for the PS3, a fireworks show before the release of the PS4.

**Runners Up: Bioshock Infinite, Gone Home, Grand Theft Auto V**

**2014: Infamous: Second Son**

Is this a perfect game? No. I wouldn't even say, objectively speaking, it's a great game. It fell into every single open world trap possible. It has a terrible morality system. The player character is too overpowered and the plot is atrocious.But, then again, I would argue that this is the first truly ""next gen"" game. It pushed graphics to new heights and made decent use of the PS4's new features, like the light bar and touch pad. It was disappointing, sure, but it kicked off a generation.

**Runners Up: P.T., Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, Far Cry 4**

**2015: The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt**

It had been four years since Skyrim and nothing had been able to become the successor to its open world. Then, The Witcher 3 happened. Coming from a series that enjoyed some critical acclaim but did not have much name recognition, The Witcher 3 arrived with a bang that I believe was unexpected by fans, critics, and the developers themselves. This game was the true ""next Skyrim,"" with fantastic side quests and a massive world to get lost in over and over again.

**Runners Up: Until Dawn, Fallout 4, Life is Strange**

**2016: Uncharted 4: A Thief's End**

If Infamous: Second Son started the generation, and The Witcher 3 brought it up to the level of some of the best games of the previous gen, Uncharted 4 finally exceeded much of what had came before. Sure, it wasn't Naughty Dogs best game (that honor still goes to The Last of Us), but it was leagues better than the average of the previous era, and I would argue was the best Uncharted game. It's just so personal, beautiful, and heartfelt. Plot inconsistencies be damned.

**Runners Up: Hitman, Final Fantasy XV, Stardew Valley**

**2017: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild**

And here it is, the most consistently amazing year in gaming in my opinion. This year delivered hit after hit, so fast that I don't think anyone could quite catch their breath. But what really stood out among the heavy competition was the new Legend of Zelda. As opposed to the PS4 and XBONE, that took their time getting their stride, the Switch jumped right out of the gate with probably the most anticipated Nintendo game in years. I could rite scores of articles on this game (it is my favourite game of all time), but in short it just changed everything. It was so new, and different, and fresh, and beautiful. It brought Zelda both back from the dead and into the limelight all at once.

**Runners Up: Persona 5, Nier: Automata, Night in the Woods**

**2018: Red Dead Redemption 2**

RDR2 feels almost like the final point for open world games. It borrows heavily from the likes of Skyrim, Breath of the Wild, and The Witcher, but it also forges its own path. It is the first truly ""alive"" open world, and its version of the American West is both vast and filled to the brim with things to do and people to meet. It is Rockstar's magnum opus, and effortlessly mixes a stunning open world with fantastic missions and butter smooth gunplay. I didn't play Red Dead 2, I lived it.

**Runners Up: Valkyria Chronicles 4, Detroit: Become Human, Ni No Kuni 2: Revenant Kingdom**

**2019: Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice**

Here we are, 2019. I still have a few games on my ""to play"" list, most notably Pokemon Sword and Shield, whih would probably be eligible for at least a runners up shoutout, but I feel comfortable enough about this list to put it out into the world. I'm especially comfortable about calling Sekiro my GOTY. I was never huge into the Soulsborne games, I've played all except Dark Souls 3 but always thought they were ""good, but not great."" The trouble I had was often they were too difficult for a solo player (#gitgud), and the controls were pretty janky. Not so with Sekiro. Being designed from the ground up for solo play and having perfectly executed swordplay really helped my enjoyment of this game, the Sengoku setting and awesome art style was just the icing on the cake.

The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,Gratitude for Telltale,"Telltale games have always been a single player experience and there aren't a lot of ways to share it. People either play the game and know what you're talking about, or they have no clue. They were never flashy AAA titles and didn't get the mainstream attention like a lot of other titles.

&#x200B;

They did mean something to me though. I've played every game Telltale put out. Paid sticker price too - I always eagerly anticipated their release and bought them on day 1. The best part for me about Telltale adventures was that there was always something in every episode that made me FEEL something - I point to these games in conversations when discussing games as art. I'm a teacher, so I also use them as examples of moral decision making. Listening to the man's heart-wrenching story in Walking Dead 1 as he says how your choices as Lee has ruined his life. Letting your anger get the best of you in Wolf Among Us and losing the trust of the people you are meant to keep safe. Morally compromising yourself to save your family - and for nothing - in Game of Thrones. And losing Loader Bot in Borderlands. Many more examples. They all spoke to me.

&#x200B;

The thing that Telltale Games did most for me is that I began to see people and relationships in the real world differently. ""Clementine will remember that"" or ""X forgives you"" made me look at my own social interactions completely differently. I saw the effect my behaviours were having and were going to have on people, and could start to empathise more strongly. I saw myself as a member of the community, and even if my actions don't have an important effect on the outcomes of lives, my interactions can make people happier or sadder.

&#x200B;

Thank you Telltale. Your games made my life better and made me a better person. ",4,6,1537743825.0
The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,I'm looking for the best open world survival game.,"So a lot of the time when I'm watching the walking dead I just think to myself, ""man I wish there was a game like that.""

The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,RDR 2 Unpopular Opinion - OVERRATED!,"Minor spoilers, I guess, for Chapter 2.

I'm going to get slaughtered for this, but it needs to be said.

After having several issues with the game so far, horses catapulting a hundred feet in the air, the worst ai I think I've encountered in a game, last night was a new low.

I was doing the mission where you meet Dutch in a pub in Valentine and Cornwall calls him. (I'm about 16 hours in, now).

This mission should have been brilliant. Get out the pub, work your way up the street in cover and escape. But it wasn't.

&#x200B;

Instead, you go out on to the street then people shoot from the left as the gang ran to a wagon on the right. The people from the left carry on shooting but you're supposed to just ignore them. So that made no sense.

Then the gang start pushing the wagon and you work your way down the street, supposedly needing to stay behind the wagon to stay in cover. You're shooting people on shop fronts, on roofs etc, but they're either not shooting at all, or they are just standing there like dummies (the ai is terrible I'm finding).

&#x200B;

Then at the end of the street, people are still shooting you from behind, the stable opens and a few more people flood out and shoot.

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, I'm told to grab Strauss and run to the horse, but the glitch here meant I was just walking around all the horses trying to figure out how I was supposed to escape. I couldn't shoot, I couldn't run (because the pacing in his game is absolutely farcical), I couldn't put him down. But don't worry. You can walk anywhere you like here, because the townsfolk all seem to have spud guns in this scene.

&#x200B;

So in the middle of a huge gunfight, I have a man on my back, walking around slow as f\*\*\*, and I can't do anything about it

&#x200B;

It makes no sense. If that's any other game it gets slaughtered for that.

&#x200B;

But it's Red Dead. Rockstar, so it is getting away with it. Everyone's turning a blind eye to some huge flaws, because they're all rose-tinted to how poor it is cause it's pretty. ""Rockstar only make fantastic games, it must be fantastic.

it isn't. Its The Order 1886 all over again.

&#x200B;

10/10 world - stunning setting

4/10 gameplay. It feels absolutely shocking.

Come at me.

Don't see a game on this list that you feel should be here? Let me explain how I compiled it. First of all, I have a worldwide audience. If a game came out anywhwere in part or in full before 2016 (such as Dreamfall Chapters), it was disqualified from the list. Second, I disqualified all remakes (such as Final Fantasy 7).  That is because the game has come out previously in some form or another, so it is not truly a new game. Third, there are some games people are excited for that don't have any sort of official release date. Since the company couldn't even say 2016 (let alone more specific), I left it off the list. Finally, I tried to put a variety of genres on the list. I think the only genre not included is sports, and that's because all I saw was the usual fare of Madden, MLB, and FIFA. While they may be new games, most of them don't introduce much new to the game and you may as well be playing a previous version of the game. Plus, I run a speculative fiction blog, so my readers won't be interested in the sports games.",2,11,1450595367.0
The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,I think I figured out who the most powerful character in all of video games is.,"In Red Dead Redemption SPOILERS there is a set of Stranger side-missions called I Know You. A mysterious man gives John a set of tasks. He knows things about John Marston and his actions that nobody can possibly know and tasks John with morality missions based on events that haven't happened yet. The quest chain concludes with the strange man and John meeting a final time. The man recites ""this is a fine spot"" right on the area where John will eventually be buried. John out of frustration says ""damn you!"" and the stranger replies ""yes, many have"". Finally, John shoots the stranger while he is walking away and is unfazed. There are many hints in this and further dialogue that make it seem like he is either God, death, or another very powerful deity. I don't think there are any video games where God is actually a character, thus this man in Red Dead Redemption is the most powerful character in all of video games. 

Edit: For people who want to argue God of War has many gods. The gods in God of War can all be killed and they cannot for-see the future. At least not accurately. They are all not THE god either.

The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,Why do games become so boring for me so fast? No game can glue me down to my seat.," Ok, first of all. I've been a hardcore gamer for a long time now ( PC exclusively ), and I have noticed that, in the past few years I jump from one game to another, every 2-3 days. Everything becomes so boring so fast. For example; I started playing stardew valley for the 10th time....i get to a point we're i'm nicely sitting, having a nice patch of land, nice amount of money, etc... (12-15 hours of gameplay ) and i'm done.... i just don't feel like going to the farm, harvesting, watering yadda yadda.... I never got around to playing Dishonored 2 ( was BIG fan of the first one ). Then got myself Dishonored 2, played it for about 25-ish hours....just starting the second to last chapter and it just got boring....I like the game mechanics, i like the setting, the game is pretty and fun and all but I just don't feel like turning on the game and playing it anymore....All of a sudden I simply don't care how the story progresses and what happens next....i spent 20+ hours with the story and now I just don't care for it anymore...Fallout 4 ( again ) but this time suuuuper moded......10hrs, done..... Warframe, was sooooooo hooked to the game...chipped in like $100 for premium currency to show support for the devs and get myself some sweet cosmetics....after that, complete stop, never opened the game afterwards, didn't even spend a dime of that premium. Downloaded The Long Dark a few days ago, when the update went live....starting a new game felt pretty good....liked the game from the first time I played it.....went on for ( you guessed it ) 10-ish hours.....pretty good sitting with resources, found a good shelter, stocked it with food/resources and now i should go to a different area because I pretty much cleared this one out.....now I just don't feel like playing anymore ( although there's a LOT of potential playtime ) I just don't feel like opening the game and walking my character to a different area of the ""world map"" and continue surviving. And that's what happens with all the games. The first 10-ish hours are a blast for me.....even games I played before and want to replay...and then just a DEAD STOP, in the matter of seconds I'm just done with the game.....I might as well shift-delete that sucker.....What's wrong with me? Is that even normal? I don't think it is.",3,33,1590262939.0

The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,"Are old cRPGs (Baldur's Gate 2, etc.) totally unappealing to anyone else?","I'm forcing myself to finish the Baldur's Gate series, sans the third (I'm waiting for the full release) and I have to say, for all the praise people have lavished these games with, they feel like total garbage to play. The praise is almost certainly in large part due to nostalgia instead of any meirt of the titles themselves. The story and characters are great, but the gameplay is somehow *worse* than the original Wizardry game; It feels like I'm playing Superman 64 all over again with how bad it is.

Skip the quoted text if you don't care for why I hold the opinion that I do.

>The first main problem is the combat. A challenging encounter consists of ""walk into a room, have your tank stunlocked to death, take ten minutes to walk to a priest and revive them, use the one scroll or spell that neutralizes the debuff, and let the AI trivially pancake the opponents that can't do anything to you anymore.""  
>  
>Every encounter that doesn't stunlock your tank and/or requires a very specific solution is trivial. It's very trial & error, and is immersion-breaking *at best*. How stupid it is makes me glad that BioWare went out of business because it's undeniable evidence of how badly they design the *game* part of their games. They'd make better books, really.  
>  
>The second problem is quest direction. The way this game handles quests is horrible. You escape the dungeon, and are told to go to the Copper Coronet to help Nalia with the Keep. If you actually **do** this you'll find one of two things: that you can't kill the trolls because you're missing fire or acid damage, or that certain encounters can't be beaten with your present setup because you lack magical items or spells that you now have to go all the way back to the city to buy, wasting an upwards of twenty minutes of your limited time on this Earth.  
>  
>This time you spend doing absolutely nothing helps you become aware of the fact that you're never getting that time back, and yet the designers still had the audacity to waste it like this. What you're ""supposed"" to do is get lucky and find an encounter with an injured man/slavers, take him to a Shadow Thief NPC, and clear that area of quests before you head to the Keep. If you *find* that encounter it's a seamless progression curve, sort of. If you don't, tough shit, I hope you enjoy Sierra-style adventure game logic.  
>  
>Of course, during that questline you'll be told to visit the Temple area and go to the sewers to do some quests there. You're given no indication whatsoever until you come across a group of people that one-shot your tanks, or a group of demi-beholders that permanently stun your frontline that you're not meant to do this area yet, so it's back to the priests over another five minutes of walking and reclaiming the dead tank's items. Riveting stuff. I sure am enjoying the world and characters, huh?  
>  
>The third problem is tied with the first two, and it's that it punishes exploration. Now, I don't know about you, but when I'm greeted with an encounter that's absurdly difficult anytime I try to actually explore, I'm not inclined to do that very much because the game has taught me that it will actively punish me for having the audacity to.  
>  
>If you want to say ""Oh, just reload!"" then that's exactly the problem: to minimize the pure inconvenience that the 'brilliant' developers who gave us Dragon Age 2 put you through, you're almost forced to rely on save-scumming encounters. Issues with immersion aside, it's an indictment on them that they couldn't think of a better way to handle progression or encounters or CC. I could also turn Story Mode on, but when it's not bombarding me with lazy attempts at ""difficulty"" that are in the modern day rightly criticized and memed on, the combat can be quite fun as I perfect the combinations of items I use to dispatch enemies most efficiently, so either way I lose out.  
>  
>All of this combined, it's like I'm being punished for playing the game at all -- a far cry from my goal of playing games for fun, really. The obtuse combat, the rocky progression, and the tendency for anything interesting to be hidden by an encounter that epitomizes the first two greatly outweigh the interesting antagonist, writing, characters and setting in the same way it did for games like Lords of the Fallen or Beyond Space.

So, here's the question, and really the entire point of this post: it could be that I'm a modern gamer with expectations that do not at all align in the slightest for what I expect of my RPGs, but how are these games so loved? From the reception of a similar post on the BG reddit and forums, I assumed it was a near-perfect game but it's the polar opposite.

I've played the original Thief and King's Field, both of which predate the Baldur's Gate games and are ***so*** much better. In the same vain, for something slightly newer, Morrowind is great and still feels good to play by comparison, so what's the deal?",0,45,1653621266.0
The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,"What if Blood Meridian received an adaptation, not as a movie, but as a video game?","I've noticed a lot of talk about the story being unfilmable, and some about making it into an animated series. However, if it's unfilmable, then how about as a video game? It's not really talked about much, but I will go further into why I think it would benefit from this.

For those who say ""we don't need a Western game because we already have RDR2,"" you might as well say that we don't need anymore Spy films because there's James Bond. In addition, what makes this a weak defense is that Blood Meridian is not Red Dead Redemption. Different stories, different themes, and so forth.

The main idea against making a film adaptation, aside from the sheer graphic violence, is how much is in the story, with both environmental descriptions and too much content to fit in a single movie. With a video game, it's easier to fit much more content in a single video game without sequels or continuation, the player can go on their own pacing, and there's always dlc. In addition, for all the blank spots left for reader interpretation, those can be translated into decisions and choice paths made by the player. And if you question about such a brutal and violent game, remember that there is TLOU1 and 2, as well as Manhunt. Now, for the other elements that help it work for a game:

For one, The Kid works perfectly as a video game protagonist. In the book, not much of his actions or thoughts are described, and left to reader interpretation. That can be utilized in a video game, where the player can make decisions and choices, and still be accurate to the original story.

With level design, and the hints and implications of the book, there is a lot of room to have environmental storytelling within the areas.

Now with the most controversial part of the previous post, as well as the entire concept of adapting Blood Meridian: Representation of Native Americans. Sure, we are playing the bad guy in the game, this would not be the first game where the player character isn't a hero or good person, and everyone is pretty sick and depraved in the book, but with video games being unique with audience input, it just becomes even more uncomfortable, and it still needs to be entertaining. And having Delawares part of the Glanton gang doesn't help either. I have some ways to tackle this:

- Add enemy diversity: Bandits, Mexican soldiers, rival scalping gangs, etc.

- They may be an enemy, but still give respect: Don't reduce them to caricatures or Noble Savage trope. Rather, make them enemies who are smart and are on their own accord with agency. They are skilled in survival, they are good at ambushing and hunting. Just because they're enemy, doesn't mean they shouldn't be respected or seen as inhuman. The themes involve how inside everyone is a barbaric, depraved monster, and the settlers are no better, if not worst, if we consider Manifest Destiny.

- When they're not in combat, have them do everyday stuff and portray their cultures accurately. One things for sure is that a lot of research should definitely be done on the tribes, as well as their norms and cultures, to demonstrate how they, just like the Americans, are human. In addition, have research and studying done for each individual tribe, to show the diversity of Native tribes in different regions. Instead of just generic stereotype Native American npcs, there's variety from Yuma, Apache, etc. When not attacking, having them with daily routines in villages like the Americans and Mexicans in towns can be used to add sympathy and have you question the Judge and the Glanton gang. Well, even without that, we still all question the Judge in everything about him.



In addition, there is a lot of room for experimentation and sandbox gameplay. For an idea, it would be like a mix of Kingdom Come: Deliverance and Far Cry 2, but more brutal and gritty, and taking place in the Wild West. Because there's a lot of blanks (traveling for days, timeskips, etc.), content can in fact be added on without straying too far from the book. For example, there's room for interactions, raiding or supporting outposts, random events, etc. Speaking of which, perhaps some non-book characters can be added that fit the theme and story, since it seemed that the Glanton gang would lose and gain members throughout its operation.

Speaking of gameplay, murdering and collecting scalps won't be the only gameplay loop. Yes, its in a dark and brutal setting, but even environments and settings can be multi-dimensional like characters. To expand on the setting, there would be:

- Hunting

- Side quests from npcs in towns and outposts.

- Escort missions for pioneers and other traveling pilgrims.

- Survival mechanics and living off the land.

- Exploration. There would definitely be a huge exploration factor, with heavy environmental storytelling as stated before. Rather than having onscreen brutality and gore, a lot of it would be heavily implied with hints in areas that seemed like something horrific occured.

With game mechanics, and especially because of how dark and brutal Blood Meridian is, there would and should be a karma system. Not something with two option buttons like Bioshock or Infamous, bit rather based on your actions. On one hand, you're partaking in genocide, and Tobin is disappointed in you. On the other, more reward from the Alcaldes, and the Judge and Glanton favor you more. Perhaps as you follow a more barbaric playthrough, regular townspeople and passive npcs will show disgust in you, and you get lower charisma skills, even affecting shopping deals and certain encounters, but in turn, the gang will respect you more, seeing you're just like them. While it affects interactions and all, it could also affect what Judge Holden says at the end. For example, if you partook in the violence, he will praise you for ""attaching with God"", or if you just let the gang do it all and loot later, he may call you out for being a hypocrite who allows things to happen. Also, the more evil and brutal your playthrough was, the more horrifying the implications are of what the Judge did to The Man in the outhouse.

A video for the idea of game morality to expand on: https://youtu.be/6RHH7M4siPM?si=8lKT56a-QQehlrVO

Speaking of the Judge, it would be interesting for how he would be. Personally, I imagined his AI as a mic between the Alien from Alien: Isolation and Saiko Chan from Saiko No Sutoka. For the segments where he is with us, it does not feel like being with a companion, but rather an indestructible stalker enemy type who is only helping us for now. There could even be hints that Judge Holden is actually aware that this is all just a game, and give him comments that he *might* know of game systems. In addition, whenever he gang is at rest, perhaps the Judge can sell you things like the Merchant or the Duke from the Resident Evil games. But what makes him so different in contrast to the player is how, no matter what messed up stuff he does, he is hardly ever affected by the karma system.

And for the obvious: Blood Meridian would be a horror game. But for most of the part, you would mostly be traversing through scenic areas. A given conflict between boredom or crazy but risky action, stopping at places or carrying on.

And that is the end of my essay. If not Blood Meridian, what other story would you like to see become a game instead?",48,27,1712004816.0
The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,VR game suggestions,"A large percentage of VR games just don’t interest me. Lots of games seem like they’re made for people new to VR to try out. Although these games are fun if you’re new to it, they don’t really have any novelty left if you know what you’re doing. Some examples of these games are blade and sorcery and space pirate trainer. I’m sure I would have enjoyed space pirate trainer if I was new to VR, but I was in incredibly disappointed.

I’m looking for more high quality/ “Triple A” games to play. To give you an idea, I compiled a list of games that I consider to be “AAA”:


Boneworks
Hellblade Senua’s Sacrifice VR (Game pass)
Subnautica VR (Epic)
Skyrim VR
Fallout 4 VR
Doom VFR
No Man’s Sky VR
Walking Dead Saints and Sinners
Half Life Alyx
Alien Isolation (With mod)
GTA V (With mod)
Doom 3 (With mod)
Chronos
Lone Echo
Lies Beneath
Robo Recall
Asgard’s Wrath
Stormland 
The Unspoken

Here’s a list of games I’m interested in playing but I would not consider “Triple A”:

Trover Saves The Universe
Batman Arkham VR
Until You Fall
Spiderman far from home
Rick and Morty virtual rickality
Creed rise to glory
Beat Saber 
Pistol Whip
Layers of Fear VR
The Wizards
The Talos Principle
Arizona Sunshine
Shadow Point
Journey of the gods
The Mage’s Tale
Arktika.1
The Unspoken
Wilson’s Heart
Edge of Nowhere 
Virtual virtual reality

I would appreciate any recommendations for more VR games. Thanks!",3,12,1589196038.0

The Walking Dead: No Man's Land,[Discussion] We have reached a peak in gaming with the PS4. Next gen will only offer better graphics and that's all. Am I wrong?,"I don't think that the next generation of consoles will bring us any new features we didn't already have. What change between PS3 and PS4? I think only graphics improved. We got bigger maps and we got more objects at run time. So a game like Assassin's Creed Unity was possible with many NPCs walking around on the streets of Paris - THAT is the only change I can think of between PS3 and PS4 IF we ignore VR. Faster loading times and nicer graphics will make things nicer but it won't change game play or anything. 

So I actually believe that almost anything could get ported to the Switch if it hasn't too many object at run time or they heavily reduce the objects. 

Basically I feel like we have reached a peak with PS4 Pro that can only be topped in graphics quality. 

Am I wrong here? How do you feel about this? What need game play changes or what not could suddenly be possible with better hardware besides VR? 

I mean I remember Dead Rising on the 360 and the Wii and I was like ""man it's just so little zombies on the Wii, it really needs more power and I can tell what is lacking"" this isn't the case anymore.",0,23,1586013472.0

Dead Trigger 2,Red Dead Redemption 2 is just too good,"Like who would have thought before this game was even announced that the badass first RDR would have a PREQUEL that is SIGNIFICANTLY better than this in pretty much every way.

As entertaining as the story is, just screwing around in the open world doing whatever the hell I feel like doing in the moment just never gets old, just continues to invest. 

I mean I just keep finding interesting and unique things of all sorts to engage myself with. 

One thing I noticed about something like.....the bounty hunting, just about every bounty hunting mission you go on has a different and unique feel to it, like something unique happens during each mission. In the first game, iirc, each bounty hunt is basically the same, just simply go to the target and head back to the jail, whether the target is dead or alive.

But that's only one example of.....several in this big open world.

I'm not even that big of a old western fan but RDR 1 and 2 just do it right

And my oh my do I adore the combat..... the dual pistol is my favorite part, and I have definitely favored the semi automatic pistols

Plus being able to customize the protagonist in a huge variety of ways is just too cool. Although I am picky about the clothing.....the attire that existed back in this time period....yikes ",480,223,1714953951.0

Currently all I’ve found that I somewhat enjoy are Asphalt 8+ and Manticore Rising. Any FPS games available? Tried to download Modern Combat 5 and Shadowgun Legends, but neither of them worked.

I just want to test the waters to see if I like it overall before I drop hundreds on a System. Any recs appreciated.",0,3,1641269057.0
Shadowgun Legends,Can anyone recommend another FPS?,"I’ve been playing a lot of BOPS 3 and IW and just your basic FPS games, I know I like playing them w friends the most, but those games aren’t really social. You can’t chat and making friends in game is rare.
I’m looking for a game where you can go on missions together etc, some kind of storyline really. One game who fits this so far is Shadowgun Legends by madfingers, too bad it’s iOS/ Android only.

GTA would also be pretty nice but I feel like it’s way to late to get into it. 
Any suggestions?",2,28,1527942137.0

(The NES and SNES games listed under Switch are from NES and SNES Online.)

Other stuff I own are the Super Mario Bros. Game & Watch, the SNES Classic Mini and the Nintendo Mini Classics' version of Mario's Cement Factory, and I played the entire library those three contain.

Can you come up with something new for me to play that I might like, but is still a bit out of my current comfort zone? Thanks a bundle!

Edit: should probably list other games I have direct or indirect access to, but have not or barely played (yet):

Portal 2, Garry's Mod, Dauntless, Fortnite, GTA V, Borderlands 2 and the Pre-Sequel, Warframe, CS-Go, DnD Online, World of Tanks Blitz and World of Warships, Aer: Memories of Old, HOB, Spellbreak, Super Mario 35 and Tetris 99, Smite, War Thunder, Destiny 2, Apex Legends, Conqueror's Blade, Crossout, DCS World, EVE Online, LotR Online, Path of Exile, Planetside 2, RuneScape, RISK, Shadow Warrior Classic, Star Wars: the Old Republic, AutoChess, 3 Out of 10, Abzû, Alien: Isolation, Battle Breakers, Cave Story +, CRSED: F.O.A.D., Crying Suns, Diabotical, Defense Grid, Timbleweed Park, Elite Dangerous, Heroes And Generals WWII, HyperScape, Jurassic World: Evolution, Might&Magic: Chess Royale, Mud Runner, Neverwinter, Pillars of Eternity, Railway Empire, Rogue Company, Roller Coaster Tycoon 3, Shadowrun Hong Kong, Returns and Dragonfall, Sludge Life, Star Trek Online, the Cycle, the Escapists 2, the World Next Door, Trackmania, Tyranny, Unreal Tournament, Where the Water Tastes Like Wine, Anno 1701, Starlink: Battle for Atlas, and finally Trails Rising.

These games can be named as well!",6,13,1610096380.0
Shadowgun Legends,"Destiny 2 vanilla, a small review.","Destiny. The game that had trouble growing up. The first one had such a rough life I didn't think there ever would be a second one.

As someone who loved the first game+DLC, I was skeptical of Destiny 2 having read various other reviews and too many prompted me not to buy (glad I didn't) but the vanilla game became free for PS+ users so I decided to give it a shot. Whilst I was waiting for it to download I was playing Shadowgun Legends on mobile (solid game btw) to get me in the FPS Looter/Shooter mood.

I checked my downloads...it was done! Booting up the game took forever, then again, it always has done since the first game.

I play the first mission with a breeze (had already completed 'Homecoming' during the beta) so I felt a bit lackluster.

I'm now 10 missions in and my god, it's actually a reasonably great game. Here's why: 

- The story is actually a story, not some stiched together mess like the first game was. 
- The cut scenes are crazy good. 
- The voice actors are amazing, Failsafe is my favourite character so far. 
- Speaking of voices, the overall sound design is *so* good that it puts a lot of other Sci-fi shooting games to shame. 
- The exploration aspects are pretty good, you can freeroam but also come across and start an ""Adventure"" which *can* take you to previously explored areas but that's okay because the Adventures are fun too. You can also find ""Lost Sectors"", having only found one and was really underpowered I didn't explore this particular Lost Sector or any Lost Sectors yet. 
- Customisation is fairly broad, applying shaders to a weapon is sweet. 
- The UI/HUD is superb and looks really well done, easy to read and figure out where things are. 

Now, here's why it's a terrible game: 

- It's too short, roughly just 17 missions? I expected a lot more considering the amount of crap the first one got with it's story but in Destiny 2's defence, there are more cutscenes and the cutscenes are amazing. 
- Also forking out £89.99 for the current UK Forsaken Collectors edition is not something I can justify only for an extra 19 missions, yes you do get all this other content and areas to explore and people to talk to but damn is the story short so I'll wait until its come down a lot in price. 
- Shaders are one-use only but they are cheap to reaquire, what a *shady* move.
- Ghaul *is* a badass but he's such a boring character.

So uhh...that's it for my mini review. I give it;
Video Quality: 8/10
Sound Quality: 9/10
Content Quality: 5/10

Overall: 7/10.

If like me, you loved the first one, you'll probably love this one more. ",3,12,1536842005.0

Dead Trigger 1,I aggregated more than 700 greatest games lists. Here are the results.,"# The Data

The source data includes any list from a reliable source and chosen primarily by the publication's editorial staff (lists based on reader polls were excluded). More than 100 publications from \~15 different countries are represented. A few lists have platform restrictions but the vast majority are unrestricted. The method is able to handle ranked lists, unranked lists, partially ranked lists, and lists with a one-per-series restriction, so all of these have been included. In total there are 98 all time lists, 51 end of decade lists, \~570 end of year lists (this includes GOTY awards), and 9 miscellaneous lists. A full list of all of the included source data can be found here: [https://www.acclaimedvideogames.com/lists/](https://www.acclaimedvideogames.com/lists/)

# The Method

Lists are weighted according to their age (newer lists are very slightly favoured), and a reputation score assigned to each publication (all of the big gaming publications have the maximum reputation score). Another weighting is then applied that essentially penalises publications for repeating themselves across multiple lists. This prevents the most prolific publications from dominating the final rankings. Then, a program tracks how often each game appears ahead of every other game on lists that they were both eligible for. The matchups on the resulting table are then rigorously cross referenced to determine which games performed the best overall. In short, the games at the top are the ones that consistently beat other highly ranked games, while rarely losing to lower ranked games.

# Background info and where to from here?

This is a project that I've been working on since early 2020. I started it because the current go to sources for gauging the critical consensus on video games, specifically Metacritic and OpenCritic, are both based on review scores. I felt like there was room for a website with a rigorous methodology that ranks games based on lists as well (for some reason there's a slight difference between games that do well in reviews and games that do well on lists). It's still early days (the website only launched last year), but I'd really like for the rankings to be taken somewhat seriously one day. Here's hoping.

The next big project will be adding more platform lists. This won't change much at the top of the list, but it should provide better resolution further down. It may also allow me to increase the list to 1500 games, which would be a nice bonus. It won't happen quickly as it requires a ton of data entry, as well as possibly writing a more careful eligibility checker (the current one is pretty good, but it doesn't always make good guesses when release dates are unknown), but hopefully I'll have at least some of it done by the end of the year. Besides that, I'll be updating to include any important lists that come in. Certain website features also need a bit of attention.

The website is not monetised in any way. There are no ads, affiliate links, subscription options, or donation pages. It will remain that way for the foreseeable future.

  
Edit: The website page numbers are not working on some browsers! This will be fixed soon, sorry!",8363,1432,1720958728.0

Dead Trigger 1,"I averaged 14 ""Best Games of All Time"" lists from the last five years together, and these are the results","# Explanation and methodology

I compiled fourteen different ""best of all time"" lists to create one definitive list. It was originally going to be a top 100 but I ended up having enough data to make a consensus top 200. For each list I gave each game a score based on placement (i.e. one point for 100th place, two points for 99th place, all the way up to 100 points for 1st place). I also gave a certain amount of extra points for simply being on the list--otherwise games that ranked low would get basically no advantage over games that didn't rank at all. The amount differed based on whether the list was a top 50, top 100, top 200, and so on. Making it onto more exclusive lists obviously granted more points. 

# Lists used

I averaged together the following lists, with diverse perspectives and recent publication being a priority in which lists I chose: 

**Media rankings**: Empire (UK, 2023), USA Today (US, 2022), Popular Mechanics (US, 2022), Looper (US, 2022) IGN (international, 2021), Slant magazine (USA, 2020) Game Informer (US, 2018) Games TM (UK, 2018)

**Critic ratings**: Metacritic top 200 Metascores of all time (as of 2023)

**Gamer ratings**: IMDB top 200 user ratings of all time (as of 2023), Ranker top 200 user ratings of all time (as of 2023)

**Critic polls**: British GQ Industry Poll (UK, 2023)

**Gamer polls:** TV Asahi viewer poll (Japan, 2021), Hobby Consolas reader poll (Spain/Latin America, 2021)

Anyways... thanks yall...  I think a big part of this game is to use use Stasis and also use objects to pick up during times when you're overwhelmed. Also, nothing wrong with running away to get your SH&\* together. 

This is a Survival Game and you have to have a strategy. 

I'm almost there and hope Dead Space 2 is as good! I hope my Windows 7 gaming PC can handle it and then maybe move onto 3 without purchasing a new console.  


Dead Space is a straight up survival and strategic game. I am still learning, but this reddit group rules. Thanks guys!!!

So an odd question...  If I'm at a save point and I cannot get past a certain stage...  should I go back to the store(which is way back) and restock on ammo and health before going forward?  I mean...  I might have not been using my inventory as I should :/  Is it necessary sometimes to do that?  I know there aren't PC cheats for the game, and frankly its lame to use cheats to beat a game so...  should I walk back to a store just to get health packs and ammo for lets say fire ammo for the flame thrower.  I'm in a space with those pesky little things that get stuck to my body and they come in armies!   :/

A big key why this game is such a success is obviously because of the choice system, but the problem with that is that your choice rarely has any consequence and you might add an extra dialogue piece but nobody will remember it.

It's more about the story obviously, I mean Jesus the way the game makes you feel as if you are Lee is amazing. Now like I said even though your choices don't matter they matter mentally. 

The game practically grabs you by your throat and puts you in the story until the very end (Where Spoilers) lee dies. 

I mean the feeling you get after the game is completely and you're on the main menu screen is something I literally cannot explain.

I'm pretty sure the main factor is how everything is running through your mind about every choice you make when Lee is dying.  I'm not sure if this is just my emotions telling me that the game is the best ever but I'm sticking to the answer.

But in the best way possible is, no matter how many times I play this game I will always either tear up or bawl my a$$ off when Lee dies.

Also the way I played the game I always sided with Kenny and I always thought of Lee and Kenny being the leaders as they kind of are and I always thought of it like Rick and Daryl. That's another reason why I think I enjoyed this game as Kenny is such a good character, whether you like him or not I've always sucked up to him In the game. I will find myself returning to the main menu to change the decision that I know won't matter in the end. The main thing is Lee, which is basically you and yet I feel envy for a video game character. 

I love lee's character so much even though you are the one making decisions for him, and it always makes me smile you remember that Lee is trying to protect Clementine. Now I know this might sound weird but, Lee can make a bad decision which is basically you, and yet Clementine will always forgive you as long as you choose the right option. It always puts a tear to my face when I remember that Lee always tried to protect Clementine, to train her and to prepare her.

And I will always no matter what have Clementine shoot Lee.
Obviously it's not cuz I hate Lee but it's because it's what Lee would want her to do.


But yeah, this game really plays with my emotions every time I play it and I'm so thankful that this game is a thing. 

Thank you for reading.


Edit: It's the next day after this post and honestly the feel right now is crazy, like the game sticks with you for a couple of days.

Dead Trigger 1,Red Dead 1 was better.,"Anybody share this opinion? Red dead 2 is too much. They tried to do way too much. And in my opinion it also just sucks to play. Controls in all aspects are incredibly unsatisfying and taxing; traversal, combat, navigating inventory/crafting/whatnot. The world building is extensive, but to beyond excess when you consider how much of the motivation to explore it is comprised of mind numbing challenges, eye strain inducing, repetitive hunting activities, near fruitless side quests, and generally difficult to physically navigate and take in. The random events are way too frequent that they actually break immersion more than help it. Countless bugs, from mild to downright game-breaking, which I think I’ve experienced just about them all unfortunately even after having to restart my play through 30 hours in due to a bug. The cons, in my opinion, go on and on.

It is a very pretty game, for certain. The weather system and lighting effects are unlike anything I’ve ever seen in a game. But I’ve seen these level graphics, just maybe not in an open world game. And I’ve played hundreds of other games that I could easily say I enjoyed more. Red dead 1 being among that list of course. 

Red dead 1 was more fun, more focused, and therefore, more impactful and resonate a work in terms of driving narrative imo, making it an all around better game in every category aside from visuals.

(Edit; guess I should clarify I mean red dead redemption 1, though I think that’s obvious)

(Also l, I have not finished the game yet. I am over 100 hours in and still in chapter 4, a testament to the games excess that I am trying to argue. But I do plan on finishing so please, don’t know why you would, but no spoilers.)",5,22,1544420586.0

I am big on story based games, I will not skip a cut scene, very immersive (i.e. metal gear). I have a sweet spot for RE games, since I used to play these back in the day on sega. Played RE2 and liked it. 

Been looking at evil within, seems like a cool gameplay specially for the second game. Also, Red dead is been recommended a lot for its story. I don't play video games a lot so I want something that is actually worth it time wise. Thoughts and opinions please.",1,5,1669529444.0

Dead Trigger 1,Help: House of the Dead 1 and Win 10 64-bit,"Hoping someone here can help me with this, I’ve just hit a wall.

I have an old MSI gaming laptop that I haven’t used in years. I spent the last few days wiping it and updating to Win 10.

The reason I did that was to get a Sinden Light Gun that I recently received to work.

Once I was able to get the gun running on the laptop, I tried inserting the House of the dead 1 OG disc I had and running it in Win 95 compatibility mode. I got an error that basically says ‘hey this is 32-bit and won’t run’.

I tried ripping the files from the disc via PowerISO and running that way, still no dice.

I keep seeing forum posts online with people getting it to run, but it all reads very sloppy and vague. Just real hard to follow.

Anyone know or can point me to how I can get it running?

And I know that the remake is on Steam but my processor is too old for the requirements on this machine.

Dead Trigger 1,Just finished Red Dead Redemption 1 for the first time. Here are my unsolicited thoughts. [Spoilers],"So first off, I was basically completely blind to the game and everything in it *except* the twist at the end, unfortunately. That being said, here are some unorganized thoughts:

- The voice acting overall was pretty good. The only notable outliers I can remember were that random girl on the train in the opening and Nastas. They were...pretty bad. Characters like Irish, Seth, John, Bonnie, and Nigel had good voice work. 

- I enjoyed his interactions with some characters, but I disliked his with others. He seemed extremely aggressive and snappy with Irish and Nigel and such. Like...I get it, he was getting over their shit, but it was just a whiplash coming off of doing his missions with the Marshal and Bonnie. 

- Hearing the same dumb ""You're about to have a bullet in your head"" quip got really old. They heavily leaned into it during cutscenes, and it was overused imo. 

- The the mini games were all pretty fun for what they were. 

- It took me quite a while to get used to the fact that there's no animation cancelling at all and how there are so many forced frames of animation for so many things. Like when running and coming to a stop, John physically slows down to a trot, then walks a step, then stops. It felt really jarring. I understand it's supposed to be more realistic and immersive, but it gave me the opposite feeling. It felt unresponsive and sluggish. Idk if this is just a Rockstar thing, because I never really play the GTA games, but yeah. 

- The game felt like it really dragged on longer than it needed to, and it constantly felt like ""the princess is in another castle!"" thing happened *a lot*. Felt like artificially padding the game in terms of playtime. I skipped basically every optional sidequest, and it still felt like it really dragged from the point you hit Mexico onwards...and *especially* when you hit Blackwater. 

- If RDR2 is more of the same but with a lot more polish, I don't know if I can handle that. Especially considering RDR2 is more than double the length of RDR1. I would love to experience the story of 2, but Idk if I can personally sit through this exact same stuff for that length of time. I will likely just watch a ""let's play"". 

- I get that Jack and Abigail were John's whole reason for doing everything in the game, but god damn they were not likeable at all. Bonnie was far more likeable than Abigail. 

- Overall it was pretty good and the gameplay itself was enjoyable (mostly), I just wish it was shorter and trimmed the fat. It could've been reduced from an 18hr game to a 12hr game and I think it would've been better for it. Part of what I loved about Gun was the pacing was fantastic. It was short and sweet, but also packed with action. In RDR1, you have the bangers, but you also have some slog story questlines that are mandatory.",0,3,1675493772.0

Dead Trigger 1,Are there any instances of janky/clunky mechanics actually contributing to the environment of the game?,"I have two examples for this:

1. Portal - Portal's overall clunkiness adds in to the eerieness. With GLaDOS glitching out constantly, you feel like the whole thing is a patchwork of shoddy work and the clunky interactions with the cubes, turrets and energy balls just elevates that feeling. 

2. Fallout New Vegas: Dead Money DLC - Like any Game with Bethesda's engine, New Vegas is janky as fuck. Everything you do feels laborious, The responsiveness feels like it's coming from a DOS game. But it's still playable, so you just adapt to it. Now introducing, a DLC where you'll be thrown inside with no Armor, no weapon, with an exploding collar that would trigger if it gets out of range of a speaker, where your entire play style upto that point needs to be redone, and you need to adapt to the jank again with bigger and stronger threats all around. That's Dead Money. The DLC makes you genuinely feel like you're trapped in a hellscape and the jank just elevates that feeling to pure hatred. But as you play through, you adapt again, you become your former self again, and by the end, you have conquered Sierra Madre. Which would not feel as rewarding as it is if it was not for the jank. 

So are there any other examples like this?",0,45,1712033007.0

Samurai II: Vengeance,Recommend a game to a poor soul,"Hello everyone. I'm in the market for a game and don't know what to play really. I've been playing Dragon Age: Inquisition for the past few days but finding myself not making a lot of progress since I only get to play an hour or two if I'm lucky so I got bored whenever I log in, kill a few things and barely make any real noticeable progress.

I'm looking for something that's fun to play at short intervals, kind of casual, single player, crafting and base building are a plus but not necessary and PC only don't have a console atm.

Here are a few games I used to play in the past which I find fun and enjoyable.

* GTA Series (except IV haven't played it and don't really intend to)
* Torchlight 1 and 2
* Old School Pokemon games (though I don't have a DS now)
* Saints Row IV
* Diablo II
* Harvest Moon (on my old psp RIP that poor old chap)
* Samurai Legends (not really a famous title but I enjoyed it nonetheless on our old PS2)
* Need for Speed Underground 1, 2 and Carbon
* God Eater (psp)
* Monster Hunter (forgot which versions)
* Terraria
* Minecraft
* Skyrim
* The Sims 3 and 4

Samurai II: Vengeance,Local multiplayer recommendations [PC],"I am going through a bit of a local multiplayer renaissance.  My friends and I were playing a lot of Samurai Gun after hockey playoff parties.  (Go Hawks!)

I am having everyone over again to specifically play games.  I think I have a good list together.  I am hoping to get some opinions/recommendations on these.  If you could, please comment on the pace and duration of the game.  I think one of the keys to keeping everyone interested is finding a game pace that matches the group/mood/flow of the party. (I'll give some examples of the games I am familiar with.)

FWIW We have all been friends since high school.  We are all around 30 now.  There will be 4 of us.  We use PS3 controllers acting as Xbox controllers (MotionJoy + BetterDS3)

In the past we have enjoyed everything from:

Competitive 

- 1v1 or 2v2 FIFA 
- 3v3 NHL arcade 
- Samurai Gun
- Speed Runners 
- Smash bros
- Nidhogg
- Dive kick (Couldn't get into it)

Co-op (Co-opetition)

- Magika (not as fun local.  Need that mouse and keyboard.)
- Fifa road to world cup/UEFA
- Castle Crashers
(NOTE: I know the above list isn't solely PC games.  Just giving some insight into what we have enjoyed in the past.  Looking for PC games now.)


###My list so far (from podcasts, steam tags, curator lists, Reddit threads, and the google):

- Broforce
- Dungeon Defenders (I II)
- Gauntlet (PC)
- Tower fall
- Trine 1,2,3 (3 player)
- Rocket league (2v2s) (Is there any 4v4 action online?)
- Spelunky
- Forced

I am especially interested in a co-op game like Gauntlet or Forced.  If you can comment on those or something similar, I would really appreciate it.",2,20,1440185542.0
Samurai II: Vengeance,My treasured games collection hit half century 🥹,,41,43,1668757451.0
Samurai II: Vengeance,Help finding an upcoming game,"I have been searching the past week or so for a game I saw a video of on YouTube that featured multiple factions fighting in melee combat for a few different nodes. The game puts things such as knights, ninjas, samurais, and other stuff I can't recall fighting each other as teams. The combat system was said on the video to have an extremely high skill ceiling and it seemed like each different faction (samurai/ninja/etc.) has their own special moves and special abilities. In the game there are computer controlled allies that you have the ability to direct and command. From what I remember it was third person. It seemed like a very well funded game focused on bringing a competitive environment to the melee combat scene. 

Thanks a bunch either way, guys.


Also :: It is NOT Pirates, Vikings, and Knights II or Chivalry:Deadliest Warrior. ",0,4,1452045613.0

Samurai II: Vengeance,The History of Ghost of Tsushima - The 6 Year Tale about the development of the last Sucker Punch game of the PS4 era (minor story spoilers).,"Hello!

My name is Nickadimoose and I'm an amateur game historian or at least I try to be when work allows. My main hobby is video-production as well as historic write-ups on video game history. Today I wanted to cover the History of Ghost of Tsushima, how it was made, the design decisions, the inspiration for it, as well as just generally talking about the game's positives and negatives aspects.

As a warning, this text has references to how the beginning of the game plays out, as well as some hints about how the story progresses in terms of the main character. If you've not finished the game or you're still playing, you may wish to hold off on reading.

After the release of Infamous Second Son and First Light in 2014, American based video game studio, Sucker Punch Productions, were looking to undertake a new challenge; after developing the Infamous franchise for 9 years straight, they wanted to test themselves creatively as a studio and make something new and different.

Though they didn’t know what they wanted to make yet, they did know one thing: that the next game had to be open world, as creative director Nate Fox explains:

“We wanted to stay open world because we’re giving authority--power to the player. We didn’t want to walk away from that, we think it’s integral to modern gaming that players are in charge.” - Nate Fox, creative director for Ghost of Tsushima.

They began to explore a few ideas, just conceptually, like pirates, Scottish Outlaw Rob Roy MacGregor, the Three Musketeers and about 70 other suggestions, but none of them felt right. Then things fell into place when they pitched one, simple concept: a Japanese samurai in feudal Japan.

It sounds perfect, doesn’t it? It’s a concept that you can instantly visualize the moment you say it.

After they settled on the idea of making a game about a samurai, it was easy to draw inspiration from outside sources and arguably none were more influential than legendary filmmaker & screenwriter, Akira Kurosawa.

For most western audiences, Kurosawa's films were the first real taste of Japanese culture. He earned renown as a filmmaker during World War II, but it wasn’t until the release of Rashomon that he would go on to become a legend. It was his unique style of focusing on the natural beauty of the land, as well as exploring the depth of his characters’ emotions that made his films so successful. This is where a lot of people developed their love affair for the iconic, honor bound samurai, including many at the Sucker Punch studio headquarters. It’s in Kurosawa’s works that a lot of Ghost’s art style and direction would be given life.

Ghost of Tsushima would borrow heavily from Kurosawa’s films for it’s visual design & overall style. Even though I couldn’t find a source saying so, I’m sure it was something like Seven Samurai that inspired the stand-off mechanic in Ghost.

It wasn’t until they poured over the history of Japan that the last piece of the conceptual puzzle finally fell into place. They now had a setting for their Kurosawa inspired, samurai epic.

The Mongol Invasion of 1274 was the first strike against Japan by Mongolian emperor, Kublai Khan.

Kublai Khan, a descendant of THE Khan, had just forced the subjugation of Korea and taken the area around modern day Beijing, creating the capital of Khanbaliq. In order to further unify his power in the region, he set his sights on the island of Japan.

On November 4th, 1274, more than 23,000 Mongol, Chinese and Korean soldiers, carried across 700 ships, poured onto the sands of Komoda Beach at the northwest tip of Tsushima Island. The Jitodai, So Sukekuni, gathered what little fighting men he had available in such a short time, 80 samurai, and began the impossible task of defending the island from the Mongol horde.

Faced with such impossible numbers, So Sukekuni and his brave samurai were overwhelmed and Tsushima was taken.

Over the next month the Mongol Navy ravaged island after island until they were met by a typhoon over the waters of the Sea of Japan, that would come to be known as the kamikaze, or the divine wind. 75% of the Mongol fighting force were lost to the kamikaze and what remained of the fleet pulled back to the shelter of Korea, biding their time & eventually recovering enough for a 2nd attempt in 1281.

As far as historical accuracy goes, the opening to Ghost of Tsushima is pretty faithful: 80 samurai, led by Lord Shimura, ride to Komoda Beach to stop the first step of the Mongolian invasion of Japan. The defense force crumbles, little by little, until the only people standing are Shimura and his nephew, Jin Sakai. In one last desperate bid, they charge Khotun Khan, intending to take his head, but ultimately fail. Shimura is taken captive and Jin is left on the beach, wounded and dying.

Even though this is the last event you’ll play in Ghost that matches up to the historical account of the true invasion, you have to admit this is the perfect place for an open world adventure to start: it’s up to you, samurai shamed in defeat, to raise an army against your oppressors, so you can take back your family, your honor, and your home.

Although it sounds easy on paper to see how the story would evolve from here and how the rest of the game would take shape, it would be nothing of the sort for the development team.

Ghost would prove to be unlike any game Sucker Punch had ever made. The road to the finish would be fraught with challenge and that challenge would threaten to bury them during every stage of development. They would need perseverance and fortitude to make it through the six long years it would take to turn a simple samurai fantasy into a full scale epic.

The art of Ghost is perfect, you have this seamless blend of natural beauty contrasted against the horrors of a brutal occupation. As you progress through the story the scenery changes along with the hero--the bright, vivid colors slowly begin to take a turn towards the bleak.

The wonders of the natural environment are still there, but they don’t stand out as starkly anymore. As you get sucked into the story, your eyes instead begin to fixate on the devastation left in the wake of the Mongol army--dead bodies strewn along the roads, houses ransacked and burned, forests stripped bare and lives forever changed and because you notice all of this a bit more, that note of pure beauty for the land doesn’t stand out as much as it did in the beginning.

You’re instantly grounded by the stakes of what you have to do as the player and the knowledge of what will happen to this beautiful place if you fail. It’s masterfully done and no doubt was a tremendous effort to achieve.

Despite how complex the task of creating a 13th century Tsushima Island was, the entire process began pretty simply: with a 10 hour flight across the Pacific Ocean.

At the beginning of the year, the research team, including lead artist, Joanna Wang, took a trip to Tsushima Island to see it for themselves: the goal was to get a sense of the island’s natural beauty, so they could take pieces of it back to the studio in Washington. To that end they recorded hours upon hours of bird song, the stillness of nature, they even photo scanned some of the local flora--in a blog written by Joanna, she talks about the experience and the motivation behind such meticulous work.

“Ghost of Tsushima is by far the biggest game we have ever made. The map is divided into three regions filled with more than forty diverse Biomes and hundreds of points of interest. Our goal when building an open world game is always if you can see it, you can reach it, with as few exceptions as possible. You will journey through lush forests, cross boggy swamp lands, and enter into frozen mountainous landscapes.

We collected so many references from movies, games, paintings, and even travel posters to draw inspiration. We want to present you with an authentic, believable world, a world that would call out to you, inviting you to explore, a world that is rich and full of surprises.” - Joanna Wang, lead artist on Ghost of Tsushima.

Thanks to being a subsidiary of Sony Entertainment, a Japanese company, the research team were able to make contact with the island’s locals, including artisans and historians, who could educate them on the island’s rich history & culture.

They would take a second trip in November, once again touring the island, speaking with locals, observing seasonal changes and even attending the festival on the sands of Komoda Beach, honoring the brave dead. It’s safe to say these trips helped develop the art-style of Ghost of Tsushima into what we know today; for a developer to be able to visit a place in person, not only once, but twice, is rare in an industry dominated by huge bottom lines and a laundry list of bankrupt studios. It was a gift. A gift they would take back home to their studio in Washington.

However they couldn’t just replicate Tsushima on a 1 to 1 scale, the island was just too big, so they were faced with the task of creating an island that could mimic the feel of the original, without the scale. Instead of creating individual assets and trying to disperse them over the world in a natural way, the team chose to focus on creating multiple procedural generation tools. The procedural generation would make the environment look more natural and also be more time efficient if changes were needed down the line.

Those procedural generation tools no doubt gave them a freedom of control that allowed them to change the environment to suit the vision they were after; whether that was removing dense foliage to keep players from getting lost in a lush forest, or just keeping the horizon clear so the visual cues could be readily seen, it was a balancing act to keep the environment navigable, but genuine.

I love how they’ve done those small visual touches too; the guiding wind for quest locations, the foxes leading to inari shrines, the torii gates, the smoke on the horizon, the golden birds, all these very visual elements that keep me engaged in the world and that gorgeous art style. It’s a really effective design.

All those visual cues wouldn’t stand out nearly as much if it wasn’t for the minimalist design for the heads up display though. In an interview with co-founder of Sucker Punch, Brian Fleming, he spoke about the inspiration for the HUD and why they chose such a simple concept:

""The art, the way that buildings are outfitted, everything in Japan tends to celebrate negative space, it tends to not be cluttered, it wants simplicity, so that has to radiate through everything we do.” Brian Fleming, co-founder of Sucker Punch.

It was a choice that could have easily backfired if the balance hadn’t been maintained between the player, the combat and the natural world; simplicity is good, but if it’s not backed up by every element of design, that same simple concept will only frustrate players.

Thanks to artists like Joanna Wang and the dedication of the research time, the art of Ghost of Tsushima stands above all other titles of the PS4 era. It’s simply exceptional and makes the world feel rich and alive.

Combat is at the core of Ghost of Tsushima, making or breaking your experience; at first glance I thought combat would be rather clumsy, but there’s this wonderful element of finesse and polish to it that you don’t understand until you try it for yourself. Throughout my time playing Ghost I felt that Jin’s movements looked real and deadly. It was only afterwards, while researching this project, that I discovered just how real it truly was.

Thanks to the help of two samurai, Masakumo Kuwami & Ryusetsu Ide, the combat of Ghost came to life in the mocap studio. The pair worked tirelessly with animation director, Billy Harper, to really nail down the specifics of how a samurai would move, how they would strike, how they would block, everything the animation team would need to recreate Jin’s fighting style faithfully.

It wasn’t only the combat they went through the trouble of portraying accurately though; thousands of hours of actor movements, actor expressions and even the horses were recorded by Billy Harper and the animation team, all to bring the world of Ghost to life and make you feel like you’re in control of a genuine samurai.

A samurai epic wouldn’t be complete without a beautiful score though and thanks to the work of Shigeru Umebayashi and ELAN Eshkeri, we have one.

In a blog written by Sucker Punch audio director, Bradley D. Meyer, composers Umebayashi and Eshkeri spoke about their experience with making the games’ score, including a look at the inspiration behind Jin’s iconic theme, Way of the Ghost and The Heart of the Jito.

Jin’s theme, “The Way of the Ghost,” was one of the very first pieces I wrote. Usually productions are ready for music after everyone else has been working on the game. As much as you might understand the story, it always takes time to really get under the skin and appreciate the depth of well written characters and story. While some of my first sketches evolved, this theme really stuck. It’s all about how the people of Tsushima see him. He is their hero: strong, infallible, inspiring and full of hope, but what really fascinated me about Jin is the contrast of what is going on inside him. In order to save his home and the people he loves he must go against everything he was taught to believe in and break the code of the Samurai. Throughout the game, Jin is a character in deep emotional conflict and this, above all else, is what drew me to Ghost.

The historical setting is fascinating. I began to study ancient Japanese music, folk songs, court music, sacred music and taiko, as well as the different pentatonic scales used in Japanese music. It is a very rich world full of a lifetime’s worth of exploration. In the game’s score I used Shakuhachi, Koto, Shamisen, Taiko Drums and Chants, and my favourite discovery, Biwa. The Biwa is an instrument that Samurai used to play and the art of it was almost lost — there are now only a few players in the world! Luckily, I was able to find one of them to play on Ghost. It’s a really special sound and you can hear it on 'The Heart of the Jito.'

I wanted to create an emotional world that would not only support the narrative and action beats of the game, but I hope it also completely draws the player into the heart and soul of Jin’s emotional journey."" - Elan Eshkeri, main composer for Ghost of Tsushima.

""When listeners hear the music for the game, I hope that they feel the hearts of the people of Tsushima – those who love the land, living and plowing with the natural bounties it offers, and those of the warriors who take their katanas and follow the way of the samurai."" - Shigeru Umebayashi, main composer for Ghost of Tsushima.

It really speaks to the power of musical composition that even if you knew nothing about the story, just hearing the first few, quiet notes of Way of the Ghost, you can feel the weight of it - it’s evocative and daring, speaking to the core struggle Ghosts’ story emphasizes without having to say a word.

Like all great works the score highlights and pulls on the emotional strings of the listener, emphasizing the positives along with the negatives, punctuating the established tone. It doesn’t try to force you to emotionally bend in these moments, one way or the next, but instead allows the story to carry you along until the music is needed to drive home the point.

All in all, the score for Ghost of Tsushima is a marvel, transporting listeners back to 13th century Japan and what it means to be a samurai.

It was 6 years of effort, hundreds, if not thousands of design choices, the hands of hundreds of talented programmers, designers, artists, composers, directors, researchers & consultants, that produced one of the best, if not the best, game of the PS4 era.

Kurosawa would always explore this idea of the old world meeting the new in his films, clashing for the soul of a culture. If Ghost of Tsushima and Sucker Punch are representative of the PS4 era, the past, I'm hard pressed to ask: what could the future offer that’s better than this? It’s a game that I think will always feel timeliness and with a free multiplayer DLC on the horizon, I hope we’ve not heard the last of Jin Sakai & The Ghost of Tsushima.

Anyways, thanks for reading. If you have any questions about the history, design elements or anything else, feel free. This is what I truly enjoy doing, so don't hold back.

TL:DR Ghost of Tsushima/Sucker Punch Productions took a lot of inspiration from Akira Kurosawa's works. Also, thank you for reading. As a small content creator who really enjoys doing these projects, it's always exciting to see the end result. Thank you, very much, for indulging me.

Samurai II: Vengeance,Looking into putting together my first rig soon to get into PC gaming (when I acquire the necessary funds). Any friendly pointers from r/gaming?,"Okay so first, I'm pretty knowledgeable when it comes to computers, and I have built them before. Second, my budget is tiny. A good friend of mine from one of my first gaming communities helped me compile a list of parts from newegg. He's going to send me his older processor, which I will also link in the list. 

Basically, I just want some outside opinions. I'm not wanting to run Skyrim on ultra in the fields of Whiterun with maximum draw distance at 60 FPS right out the door, but maybe mid-high settings with a respectable framerate. As it stands, my computer (a 3-year-old laptop) plays WoW at 20-ish FPS at all low settings, and TECHNICALLY shouldn't play Diablo III, although I found a workaround, albeit with an unholy amount of input lag.

That said, here's what we compiled. I'm on a mega-budget, but I don't want to cut back TOO much. I want to be able to upgrade later, but I don't want to feel like I HAVE to upgrade immediately. I'm looking for maybe something that might be as good/a better option for the price.

And there's that. Sorry about the wall of text, trying to be informative when asking for other opinions. I'm just trying to shy away from the XBOX, pretty much.

Samurai II: Vengeance,Possibilities for the MGU (Marvel Gaming Universe),"With Spider-Man being such a spectacular success, and of course because the plans to further expand the MGU have been announced (with Spider-Man being considered to the MGU what Iron Man is to the MCU), we gamers have a lot to look forward to.  


I know discussions have taken place in probably every one of the millions of Spider-Man threads that have popped up since the game launched, but I'm really interested in what could be coming down the line and wanted to have a focused discussion about game ideas and how these games could all work and be as good and successful as Spider-Man.  


So, here are some of my ideas for MGU games, and I would LOVE to hear yours as well.  


1. *Captain America* \- Set during Cap's days as the leader of the Howling Commandos during World War II, *Captain America* would play as a third-person action/shooter game with extra attention placed on Cap's physical abilities. The shooting mechanics would be fluid, but they would be secondary to Cap's Melee prowess. A heavy focus would be on Cap's Shield, which he can use to deflect attacks, as well as throw during combat. The story would involve Howling Commando's missions and be interwoven with flashbacks to Steve Roger's days as a scrawny kid just trying to survive in 30's and 40's Brooklyn, and his friendship with Bucky Barnes.
2. *Ghost Rider* \- *Ghost Rider* would be a third person action game all about vengeance. As Robbie Reyes, players must help the Spirit of Vengeance settle his score. You will be able to cruise around in the Hell Charger dishing out vengeance to the many sinister individuals of Los Angeles, while also trying to catch up to an enemy far more powerful and threatening. The Spirit of Vengeance cannot be killed, but its host, Robbie Reyes, can - by divine weapons. After the first handful of missions in the game in which you are practically unstoppable, you start to encounter these divine weapons being used by street level thugs, and now Robbie Reyes faces a true mortal threat. He must not only survive these encounters, but discover where these weapons are coming from and destroy them all. Combat mechanics will of course involve the fiery chain-whip, brutal hand-to-hand power, and the ability to set inanimate objects on fire and use them as weapons. Basic level thugs can be essentially cast aside, but the Spirit of Vengeance demands that particularly heinous individuals be incinerated so their souls are sent straight to hell.
3. *Black Widow* \- *Black Widow* would be a stealth/spy caper not entirely unlike Splinter Cell, with a bit of Mission: Impossible and even Hitman thrown in. The first bit of the game will have you trying to covertly infiltrate Stark Industries to steal information. As the plot unfolds, Romanoff shifts allegiance and begins working alongside Stark and The Avengers to stop a new threat. Game play will involve Stealth, Subterfuge, and fast-kinetic melee combat. 
4. *Black Panther* \- A Predator lurks in the African jungles, waiting to strike at the hearts of evil men from the shadows. Think Far Cry, except third person, and most of your enemies are actually AFRAID of you.. and you don't use guns. The Black Panther is a warrior of the hidden nation of Wakanda, but to the rest of Africa, he is a myth told to scare people from engaging in criminal affairs. *Black Panther* will involve stealth-like mechanics that are more along the lines of tracking, stalking and hunting prey. T'Challa is extremely formidable in combat against dozens of enemies thanks to his heightened abilities and armored Black Panther suit, but prefers to systematically dismantle groups from the darkness, instilling fear and perpetuating the myth. Lots of hiding, climbing, laying traps and distractions and ambushing at the right moment, but a skilled player can use T'Challa's enhanced strength, speed and agility to run in and take down a group of enemies all at once. T'Challa is NOT impervious to damage while wearing the Black Panther armor - although the armor does defend against piercing weapons like blades and bullets, due to the nature of the Vibranium being woven into fabric so that it will stretch and flex, it is not as strong as solid Vibranium, and  T'Challa still feels the blunt force of impacts, so he still takes - albeit reduced - damage from every sort of attack.
5. *Fury* \- *Fury* is all about Samuel L. Jackson's interpretation of Nick Fury during his exploits as an Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. prior to his promotion to the role of Director. *Fury* will play somewhat like a 3rd person James Bond adventure, following Nick Fury as he's dispatched on numerous top secret missions in pursuit of an ultimate villainous threat. Making use of many different technologically advanced gadgets developed by S.H.I.E.L.D., Fury's missions often involve a level of covert spy detail, subterfuge, and typically unbridled chaos and destruction during ex-filtration. To set this game experience apart from Black Widow, there is a much larger emphasis on actual gadget and weaponry based combat rather than pure stealth. Although Nick Fury will have moments where stealth is paramount, the nature of these missions requires less-than-covert techniques and Fury will usually find himself battling his way out of the situations he sneaked into. Very much like Bond, only less suave propriety and more bad-ass swagger. Phil Coulson absolutely makes an appearance here. 

So those are just a handful of ideas on how other characters could be established in the MGU. Obviously Cap would need to end up in modern day, but we've seen that movie so I don't think we need to see it in the game. The games would run in a parallel cannon, obviously, just as Spider-Man does - but there will be more focus on keeping things relatively inline with the MCU than the comics. ",7,0,1537024944.0
Samurai II: Vengeance,i posted this on facebook.... needless to say it belongs here sorry if repost,"Loveless
 
The Prologue:
When the war of the beasts brings about the world's end,
The goddess descends from the sky
 
Wings of light and dark spread afar,
She guides us to bliss, her gift everlasting...
 
 
 
 
 
 
Act I:
 
Infinite in mystery is the gift of the goddess
We seek it thus, and take to the sky.
Ripples form on the water's surface
The wandering soul knows no rest.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Act II:
 
My Friend, your desire
Is the bringer of life, the gift of the goddess?
 
Legend shall speak of sacrifice at worlds end.
The wind sails over the water's surface
Quietly, but surely...
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Act III:
 
As the war sends the world hurtling towards destruction
The prisoner departs with his newfound love
And embarks on a new journey.
 
He is guided by hope that the gift will bring bliss
And the oath that he swore to his friends.
 
Though no oath is shared between the lovers,
In their hearts they know they will meet again.
 
 
 
Act IV:
 
There is no hate, only joy
For you are beloved by the goddess.
Hero of the Dawn, Healer of Worlds.
 
Three friends go into battle
One is captured,
One flies away,
The one that is left becomes a hero.
If we were to enact it,
would I be the one to play the hero,
Or would You?
Indeed
After all, your glory should have been mine.
 
My Friend, the fates are cruel
There are no dreams, no honour remains.
The arrow has left the bow of the goddess.
 
My Soul corrupted by vengeance,
Hath endures torment,
To find the end of the journey in my own salvation.
And your eternal slumber.
 
Now what i want most...
is the 'Gift of the Goddess'...
 
 
Act V:
 
Dreams of the morrow hath shattered soul
Pride is Lost.
 
Wings stripped away, the end is nigh
Such is... the fate of a monster.
 
Even if the morrow is barren of promises,
nothing shall forestall my return.
If this world seeks my destruction...
... It goes with Me
 
 
 
ACT Vl
 
Even if the morrow is barren of promises,
Nothing shall fortell my return
 
To become the dew that quenches the land,
To spare the sands, the seas, the skies
I offer thee this silent sacrifice",0,1,1341897347.0

Samurai II: Vengeance,"The Pledge, the Turn, and the Prestige: A narrative-focused analysis of The Last of Us Part II.","**Disclaimer and Disclosure**: This review contains spoilers of nearly all major plot points in The Last of Us Part II. I completed The Last of Us on grounded mode because I am a masochist. I am currently playing through The Last of Us Part II, but have watched my wife play through the entirety of the game.

The framing device for *The Prestige* (a film primarily about two magicians whose fates are brutally and inextricably linked) is a monologue by Michael Caine’s character about the three parts to a magic trick. With echoes of the three-act structure, Caine explains that the first part, the “Pledge,” is the presentation of something the audience is familiar with. The second part, “the Turn,” brings awe and disbelief—in the film, this is the magician’s disappearance from the stage. At this point, Caine says, the audience is trying to find the secret, waiting for the resolution, because making something disappear isn’t enough—you have to bring it back. And that journey, the “Prestige,” is the hardest part.

**The Pledge** 

>!The end of The Last of Us has Joel and Ellie safe on the outskirts of Jackson, having survived a nearly endless onslaught of horrors ranging from the horde of infected that plague the world to the innumerable factions of tattered survivors the plague created. Ellie’s safety, however, comes at an incredible cost—the obvious societal cost is the devastating loss of a cure, but the personal cost is a destabilizing force in Joel and Ellie’s relationship, buried just below the surface. Despite everything they’ve gone through together and all they mean to each other, Joel risks undermining the whole of Ellie’s trust in him by taking away Ellie’s agency and choice as to what she does with her own life. This is what the audience knows at the outset of The Last of Us Part II.!<

>!Entering the game, you play as Ellie wandering through the streets of Jackson after a tough night, surrounded by burgeoning life and community—there are stores and pubs, theaters and children playing about. This hard-won slice of freedom from the infected is small compared to the wide world, but it’s a sanctuary, and it’s theirs.!<

>!Soon after, we switch to playing as Abby, an initially nameless girl who arrives in Jackson on a desperate mission. When we first meet her, we’re not sure who she is, what role she has to play, or how long we’ll be playing from her perspective—in retrospect, this is not only the beginning of the interweaving of Abby and Ellie’s storylines, but also our first experience with asymmetric information. As the audience, we carry Joel’s devastating secret to be kept safe from Ellie, but as the narrative unfolds, we become keenly aware that many characters in the story harbor secrets from us as well.!<

>!A short while into the game, we see the brutal killing of Joel at the hands of Abby. When the game was first released, several reviewers noted that the game was being review-bombed by users, leading to extremely disparate critic and user scores. They also noted that these reviews had come in just several hours after the release of the game, suggesting that most of them had been posted without the user having played through the entire game.!<

>!I think it’s clear that the review-bombing was in part a reaction to Joel’s murder—not just the fact of it happening, but the confluence of events that leads to it. As you play as Abby for the first time, you feel out of place—you play a character you don’t know or understand, but you are carrying out whatever semblance of a plan she has. This is different from the player experience in the original. In The Last of Us, you play as Joel and Ellie, knowing for the most part what their intentions are, and what they feel at each turn. Their choices are hard, but understandable, and players are well within the moral window to rationalize and support those choices.!<

>!As Abby, you run into Joel and Tommy and you help each other escape a terrifying onslaught of infected. Moments of extreme pressure and survival make for fast friends, but Abby uses that trust to bring Joel and Tommy back to her campsite where she ultimately tortures and kills Joel. It feels bad because a seemingly random girl wandering the mountains in search of Joel overcomes immensely improbable odds to kill a hero. It feels bad because she betrays a trust forged in the chaos of survival to do so. And it feels bad because the game makes the player complicit in Joel’s murder. But needling in the back of my mind is Joel’s secret. Watching Ellie witness Joel’s murder is heart-wrenching—I had to actively take some time to process it—but even in the moment, I couldn’t help but think that it had to be related to the cure Joel took from the world, and that Abby had a deeply personal stake.!<

>!The response from the community since the release of The Last of Us Part II has ranged from a deep appreciation for the game’s invocation of strong emotion to the misdirected anger and despicable death threats toward Abby’s voice actor, Laura Bailey. Joel’s death is a catastrophic event that shakes the player and the entire town of Jackson, but the fact of his secret cannot be forgotten. Obvious but obfuscated, Joel’s act of saving Ellie is the center of the story. It represents the love and restoration of a man who lost his daughter, lost everything. It represents the pain of betraying a loved one’s trust to keep that person safe. But it also represents the irretrievable cost of that choice to the whole of humanity.!<

>!Once you believe that Abby’s mission was personal and certainly related to Joel’s choice, a parallel forms—Abby is the dark half of Ellie. Fierce, even when alone, she is a survivor, fighting against impossible odds, against the professed wisdom of the collective, toward a singular goal in the chaos of the world. What we see in Abby is what vengeance looks like, even in the face of wrongs that are far past undoing.!<

**The Turn**

>!Ellie and Tommy are left alive by Abby and her crew, and they each embark (Tommy first, Ellie second, accompanied by her love interest, Dina) on a journey to avenge Joel. The player understands Ellie’s journey: Joel may have taken the cure from the world, but Ellie has no idea. As the narrative progresses, we see beautiful, comparatively serene flashbacks interwoven with the intense horror and stress of Ellie’s present journey. All the while, we see shadows of Joel’s secret echoing around Ellie in the past—the memories of a former Firefly who committed suicide after the group’s failure to stabilize society, Ellie unsuccessfully pushing Joel for answers when her doubts inevitably resurface. The player understands—Ellie is blameless here, because she was robbed of her choice, and cannot fathom why a group of people would travel nearly a thousand miles to murder Joel in cold blood.!<

>!But we learn that she knew all along. After Ellie confronts Nora (who Ellie later tortures for information on Abby), we are brought to a flashback several years prior where Ellie issues an ultimatum, and demands answers from Joel after she revisits the Firefly hospital where they were going to develop the vaccine. !<

>!He gives them. He tells her that creating a cure meant that she would have to die. That he couldn’t let that happen. And (through subtext) that even if she grew to resent him for his choice, it would still mean she was alive to do so.!<

>!This drastically changes the tenor of our outlook on Ellie’s journey to Seattle—it’s not that she doesn’t know why Abby killed Joel, it’s that she doesn’t care. We aren’t severed from our connection with Ellie as a character by any means, but we begin to understand it a little less. Nora’s conversation with Ellie tells us that Abby killed Joel because of what he did. Ellie knows this, but against her need for vengeance, it does not matter. She pushes forward, and we understand her a little less with each kill, with Ellie ultimately murdering Owen (Abby’s close friend and love interest) and Mel (a WLF medic pregnant with Owen’s child) before returning to her Seattle hideout, and abandoning the hunt for Abby.!<

>!All the while, the narrative neatly slots in parallels between Ellie and Abby—Ellie’s mission essentially traces Abby’s mission in reverse, both having love interests involved in pregnancies with another person. We begin to see that Abby may not be the dark half of Ellie, but rather an opposing reflection.!<

>!The end of Ellie’s journey in Seattle dovetails with Abby’s, just as we are brought back to the movie theater that Ellie and her crew use as a local base for the last time. The morning that Ellie and company prepare for their journey back to Jackson, Abby arrives, killing Jesse (the father of Dina’s child), and injuring Tommy. As Abby holds a gun to Ellie, telling her that she found the bodies of her friends that Ellie killed, telling her that Ellie and Tommy squandered their chance at living after she chose to leave them alive, we wake up as Abby on the morning of her first day back from killing Joel.!<

>!Abby’s story begins with a feeling of community within the WLF stadium not dissimilar to what we experience when we first walk through Jackson as Ellie. We walk in her shoes, experiencing life and all the little moments that make us human. We see the faces of those that Ellie killed, living their lives in the haven this group built. We see the aquarium Owen discovers with Abby, echoing Joel’s birthday gift to Ellie of the natural history museum tour. And we learn that Abby’s father was the first doctor that Joel shot as he entered the operating room to rescue an unconscious Ellie.!<

>!As we are introduced to Abby’s world, we see her wrestling with her part in an ongoing war between the WLF and the Seraphites. By the end of her first day back, she finds herself captured by the enemy, narrowly being rescued by two defectors from the religious sect—a sister and a brother (Yara and Lev). Yara’s left arm is shattered by the Seraphites, but the trio manages to escape together. After they reach a place of safety, Abby splints Yara’s arm and leaves.!<

>!That night, Owen tells Abby a story about an old Seraphite he encountered during a skirmish. The old man didn’t try to retrieve his weapon or continue fighting when his unit was overwhelmed—he just looked tired, and ready to die. That story wandering in her mind, Abby returns for Yara and Lev the next day and brings them to the aquarium for treatment and safekeeping.!<

>!Unfortunately, the conflict between the WLF and the Seraphites escalates into all-out war, and Abby finds herself rushing into the fray with Yara to rescue Lev, who has gone back to save his mother. The Seraphites’ island is in chaos and ruin—fire engulfs nearly everything in sight, Lev kills his mother in self-defense, Yara dies saving Abby, and Abby and Lev narrowly escape the island.!<

>!At this point, Abby has had a real challenge of a day. Her world has been turned upside-down, her closest friend is leaving for Santa Barbara to chase rumors of the Fireflies regrouping, and she just fought through the front lines of an active warzone to save the life of a former Seraphite. She returns to the aquarium for a bit of rest, but finds Owen, Mel, and her dog, Alice, all dead.!<

>!This brings us back to the intersection of Ellie and Abby’s stories. Abby holds a gun at Ellie after having killed Jesse, with Tommy cowering on the floor. She’s prepared to shoot when a sudden scuffle leaves Tommy badly wounded, with Abby chasing Ellie through the theater.!<

>!The ensuing battle is emotionally difficult to play. You control Abby, chasing and beating Ellie down, at one point, nearly strangling her to death. But as I watched the fight play out, my misgivings about Ellie’s intentions evaporated—it didn’t matter that she was single-minded in her vengeance, it didn’t matter that she knew about Joel’s secret. All that mattered was that she lived.!<

>!Abby ultimately defeats Ellie, moving to slit Dina’s throat before finishing Ellie off, but Lev intervenes. The former Seraphite, the boy who was told by his mother and clan that he was wrong about who he was, embodies whatever forgiveness and peace Abby can muster. And in the end, it’s enough. Abby leaves Dina and Ellie alive, warning Ellie to stay away from her, and heads to Santa Barbara with Lev.!<

**The Prestige**

>!We wake up as Ellie on a small farm with Dina and her newborn child, Potato (given name J.J., probably for Joel and Jesse). You find Dina in the kitchen doing something or other, you search for a toy elephant of Potato’s in the front yard, you meander through your vegetable garden before tending to your flock of sheep in the backyard—everything is idyllic, peaceful, at rest. !<

>!It could end here. Ellie could be content and live out the rest of her life on a small, self-sufficient farm with her love and their child. She could spend her days just living, traveling the short path between her hard-won slice of solace and the town of Jackson, wandering into town to see familiar faces, come and go as she pleased.!<

>!It could end here, and Ellie might be happy—but it’s not that simple. The sound of metal cracking against a hard surface—a shovel in the barn—brings Ellie right back into the basement where Joel was tortured. She relives that moment in her mind over and over, with stray sounds able to leave her stranded in the memory, alone. She hears him begging for her to rescue him, for her to be strong enough, but of course, she can’t. She hears him die thousands of times—she can’t sleep, she can’t eat—until finally, one night, she begins packing her backpack.!<

>!Dina finds Ellie in the middle of the night preparing for the journey. She doesn’t want to think it, but she knows that Ellie is going after Abby. Ellie tells her so. Dina says that she can’t handle waiting anymore, wondering day after day if Ellie is dead or alive, but Ellie won’t change her mind—she’s going. !<

>!Ellie’s departure feels like a ghastly unearthing. I can understand this as an attempt to rid herself of her PTSD—in fact, with everything she’s gone through, I’m surprised she doesn’t have infinitely more triggers. I can also understand the heat-of-the-moment promise she made to Tommy to make Abby pay after she shot him and he was left for dead. But watching everything unfold in what felt like an epilogue, I wondered if vengeance alone was sufficient to drive her to what almost certainly was her final journey.!<

>!We switch to Abby’s perspective one last time as she searches for the Fireflies with Lev. She finds a way to rendezvous with the regathering group, but is immediately captured by a brutal frat-like group that seems to pit their prisoners against infected in cage matches for their amusement.!<

>!You arrive as Ellie in Santa Barbara a couple of months later. You cut a swath through the Rattler ranks, ultimately finding Abby bound to a tall post on the beach, delirious, emaciated, tired. Ellie cuts Abby down, who in turn, cuts Lev down. Abby tells Ellie there are a few boats nearby they could use to escape. Ellie says nothing, but follows quietly.!<

>!What follows is an emotionally brutal battle between Ellie and Abby. When they reach the boats, Ellie tells Abby she can’t just let her go with Lev.  Your heart sinks—why, Ellie—but Abby refuses to fight, until Ellie threatens to kill an unconscious Lev.!<

>!In my mind, I was fairly convinced that Ellie and Abby would both live. The combat sequence made me unsure. Each punch or grapple in the prolonged back-and-forth fight scene was agony, waiting for something to give, waiting for the end to come, until finally Ellie pins Abby beneath the water. She strangles and begins to drown her, holding Abby’s head underwater as she flails helplessly. A moment passes. Another. And then it happens—a single frame of Joel with his guitar, bathed in porchlight, flashes in her mind, and she stops. Ellie releases Abby, and tells her to just leave with Lev—and Abby does.!<

>!In one of the first scenes of the game, Joel visits Ellie at night, and plays a song for her on guitar: Future Days by Pearl Jam. The first lines: “If I ever were to lose you / I’d surely lose myself.” Throughout the game, we watch Ellie pick up various guitars and play a few notes of that song here and there, in remembrance. There is, however, a reason she never finishes it. It’s not because she can’t, although she is missing several fingers after her final confrontation with Abby—it’s because the song isn’t hers. The lyrics are beautiful, but the refrain is really Joel’s. The Last of Us was about Joel finding someone to live for, someone to love, and someone worth dying for, after having nothing and no one for so long. When Ellie lets Abby go, it’s not because she realizes that cycles of violence are pointless. I believe it’s because she realizes that she is more than just her relationship with Joel.!<

>!For the longest time after Joel tells Ellie the truth, she believes that she was supposed to die in that Firefly hospital, and that her death would be a gift to the world. Once Joel took that away, her purpose vanished as well—if she was not a cure, then she was nothing at all, just a husk of what could have been. !<

>!Whatever you may think of what Joel did, he gave Ellie a chance at life. He was willing to sacrifice everything to do it, and if given the chance to do it all over again, as he tells her in our final flashback, he would make the same choice. For Joel, the loss of Ellie would be the loss of himself, but what Ellie realizes in her moment of clarity is that her loss of Joel does not mean she has to lose herself too. We are more than what we can do for others, and we have value simply in living our lives.!<

>!The Last of Us Part II is a stellar piece of storytelling. Imperfect, sure, but it feels silly to magnify the imperfections until they blot out what is an eminently worthy conclusion to the original game. What everyone on The Last of Us Part II team crafted was nothing short of magic—through music, narrative, details, and gameplay, they unearthed the shallow-buried secret that defined the first installment, complicating our heroes and making us complicit in their questionable decisions and actions, journeying through fresh hellscapes and endless cycles of violence, until we arrive at the end with our hero, her humanity alive, and our faith in her just a bit worse for wear.!<",3,7,1594349393.0

Samurai II: Vengeance,TFW when your parents think they're just throwing out the trash.,"This is a little emotional story, at least for me. I needed to write it down somewhere and share it, and i think this might be one of the few places where people can ""get it"".

So i've moved out from my parents quite some time ago. Initially to a student dorm: 11 square meters of 'living space'. Only fairly recently did i move to a proper appartment. For various reasons i don't have regular contact with my parents.

Stick with me on this.

Out of the blue, they contacted me with whether they can come by next week. Sure, why not? It'll only be the fourth time in over a decade they made the effort to come to me. I was kind of looking forward to mend some bridges after some rough times.

So they asked me what they should bring along when they do. All of my game boxes, i told them.

I still had a lot of big boxes from mostly PC games in my old room at their place. Late 90's, early 00's. 

Had, being the operative word.

""Oh those? We've thrown those out."" - Was the casual reply. I was kind of stunned for a few moments. A little in shock, i didn't really say much after that. We said bye and see ya next week.

They were *just boxes* they thought, and so i tried to tell myself. But.... Not really.

An original big box version of Grand Prix 2. I remember going out with my dad for some computer supplies he needed, he brought me to this quaint little electronics store which had a computer department in the cellar. When we went they prominently had a beefy PC - for the time - running with Grand Prix 2 to try out, along with a Logitech Wingman 3D Extreme. As a kid i was sold on it instantly. It kickstarted my love for Formula 1 as well: We got the game soon after when we needed a proper new PC (we got a Pentium 100MHz with a whopping 8MB RAM and a brand spanking new Windows 95 copy, with box!). I still remember trying to do a no-assists, 100% distance race on the Hockenheim circuit with the joystick as soon as i had it installed. 

A collection box came with the PC, ""megagames 10"" i believe. Novastorm was in there, which i thought was amazing at the time. So did my parents. FMV still wasn't really breaking through elsewhere. 

Then there was an original big box Morrowind Collector's Edition, with the ordinator figurine in it. I spent 2,5 hours biking to the nearest store which sold it at the Dutch release date with a friend of mine, before school started. It took quite a bit of my time then...

MechWarrior 4: Vengeance was another one. The first game i played online rather religiously, even joining a clan and being fairly good at it, despite having to figure out how to join them during the small hours of the day, most activity being during US peak times. I've met some people there i still have contact with today, 16 years later, across the pond.

The original Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate 2, the latter of which i also made a point of getting at release day. I spent months and months playing through them, talking about it with my best friend at the time, sharing experiences. They blew my mind. 

Powerslide: A game i got for (what would now be) 2,50 euros, where it should have been 25. A happy mistake at the shop. Along with Need for Speed II SE, one of the first games i tried when i got a Voodoo 2 card.

FX Fighter Turbo, something i spent an embarrassing amount of time on with my friends. 

Total Annihilation. M.A.X. Alpha Centauri. Civilization II. MechWarrior 3. Quake (1). MDK. Kind of a 'biggest hits of the late 90's/early 00's' collection. Many more, just thrown out, inluding manuals and everything. 

My childhood - At least a large part of it - Gone. Most of them were even paid for with my own money which i saved up or earned.

Maybe this sounds a bit melodramatic, but i did cry for a bit...

I just needed to get this out somewhere. I felt like this would be one of the few places where there'd be people who'd understand the feeling...

EDIT: I feel i should say this in closing: I do still have at least most of the CD's in their jewel cases (most heavily scratched though), which were the only thing i could bring with me to my cramped student room. It's mostly the boxes, manuals and other extras in them that are lost. 

Still, i was looking forward to having them on show in my new gaming cave on the shelves, and the boxes represent a lot of memories i had from that time where i *heavily* got into gaming as a whole. I thought about looking on ebay for replacements, but well... It's kinda pointless. Those boxes just don't have the associated memories, if they're even the same ones. Which brings me back to where a friend of mine and me bought the Hellfire expansion for Diablo 1 together, and we gave the box to one another every other week or so. Sadly that one was lost including the CD :/

Most of the games i bought again later, through steam, gog or other places, but it's just not the same, innit?",25,16,1529183718.0
Samurai II: Vengeance,Im looking for help/advice.,"Alright, I'm looking to build a gaming computer this upcoming summer since I recently got hired at a new job. I want the computer to be able to run certain games like Starcraft II on a moderately high graphics setting, but unfortunately I am not to experienced in the field of building computers. So this is where I need some guidance, I have a build (that I will show) but its over a $1000 (about $1200 to be exact) and I want to keep it with in the price range of about $900 to 1000$ Max, I'm also not sure if all the parts are compatible with each other.

A variety of deadly weapons are at his disposal to help him survive and escape from prison.

DICE’s rendering architect has revealed that Battlefield 3 will not even run at 720p on home consoles, but instead at 704p to improve performance.

Apparently this is common practice and some well known games are listed with their resolutions. Should we feel cheated in a way....?

Samurai II: Vengeance,"[SPOILERS] I hated The Last of Us Part II on release, played the remaster 4 years later to see if my opinions changed, here's how it went! SUPER LONG POST","Ok... before anything, I want to be absolutely clear that I'm open to discussing anything here in a civil manner, even though we may agree or disagree, I want to be absolutely open to any type of discussion regarding this game.

Context: I hated the game when it came out, I was spoiled beforehand and yes... I admit that even after watching the entire game in a playthrough, I still hated everything about it. But it's been 4 years, and I feel like it was time for me to go back and actually play it myself and see if the hate still resides. I tried and told myself I would be as objective as possible, and I admittedly failed to some extent, but my opinion has changed in a lot of aspects, so I want to start with what I really enjoyed about the game, and what I hated (Story wise because the gameplay has pretty much no complaints from me), and I want to discuss it here.



The Good:

- The Graphics: 4 years later, this game is a masterpiece graphics wise, nothing comes close to it, Naughty Dog clearly put way too much effort into even the smallest things in this game, so I can't even criticize it, it's absolute perfection.

- The Combat: Clearly the best part of the game in my opinion, I never got tired of it and was always observing the gore and damage I've done to my enemies, you can be as creative as you want in this game, and the enemy AI is really impressive and love the little details they put into it. I was never bored because the combat and pacing was relatively well done.

- Both Ellie's and Abby's sections were really fun, I admittedly think Abby has the best sections of the entire game, and all of their weapons are fun to use in creative ways.

- No Return is an amazing mode and what sold me as well to giving this game a second try.

- Story (Parts I liked):

 + I did sympathize with Abby (Not because of her father, screw him in my opinion), but deep down even by the final fight I had to admit that I did not want Abby to die.

+ Yara and Lev definitely are an interesting duo of characters, and they did grow on me as I kept playing

+ One of my favourite things to do in both games is look for the notes to see the lore and side stories that you could piece together from collecting them, and TLOU2 really delivered on this, I loved seeing how certain sections of the game ended up the way they were because of the explanation of said notes, I will always appreciate this in games.

+ Joel's flashbacks are one of the best parts of the game, especially the final one revealing that Ellie lost her chance to forgive him even when they were going to start rebuilding their relationship

The Bad (This will be long, sorry...):

+ Joel's Death: 

   Let me clear something up, I don't care that Joel dies, I already expected this even before the game released, but I don't like when and how it happens. Joel has been a ruthless survivor for 20 years, being a hunter/hunted and is clearly not a good gut by any standards, but I REFUSE to accept the argument that he has gone soft in the 4 years he stayed in Jackson. I know this because when we meet Tommy in the first game, the first thing that happens is that they're attacked by raiders, and Tommy acknowledges that they have been raided for a while. You can argue that by the second game they were not raided in any way, but I don't buy that by the standards of the apocalypse that we are set in, how ruthless people can be and how vengeful some can be (Fireflies, David's cannibal group, hunters, WLF, etc...). 

   Another factor is that Joel is on patrols with Tommy, and has encountered combat with infected, we even see this in the flashbacks with Ellie like the bloater fight. Joel is also known to be untrustworthy and given the history of the things that he has done with Tommy in the past, Joel definitely is scarred by that experience. I seriously believe that the only reason Joel dies is due to The Idiot Plot being set on him, dumbing him down for the sake of plot convenience. Joel never asks the group or Abby who they are or why they are in Jackson, he gives his name away like an idiot knowing he has made a shit ton of enemies throughout his life, he's not cautious and puts himself in the middle of the room instead of keeping his guard up. He doesn't even suspect that these group of people could be bad in any capacity, Tommy and Joel just straight up walk into a possible death trap without questioning their decisions.

  Abby also just gets handed Joel in a silver platter. Abby just very conveniently runs into the patrol group out of the many other patrol groups in the perfect time to find the man she was looking for. Owen is hesitant of having to engage Jackson to get info on Joel's whereabouts, so Joel being handed to her feels very cheap and super convenient that I can't let that go at all. All the circumstances of how Joel's death happens are very convenient and I can't look past that. The when it happens in the story is also an issue, but I'll bundle that issue with the order of things in general issue.



+ Abby:

   I know I said that I sympathize with her, and I do, but the way they do it is very noticeably manipulative. Remember how I said that Abby's section of the game are the best parts of it? Yeah, at one point it became apparent that the developers felt that it would be hard to sell Abby being playable after killing Joel and now Jesse, so to compensate for the wound of the next 10 hours they give you the most fun and arguably better weapons of the game. I already praised how much I enjoyed Abby's section, but now I'm criticizing the implication of the way her section was built. She gets a better crossbow with more durable ammo, she gets to craft dragon breath ammo for her in my opinion cooler shotgun, she can craft ammo for this game's version of El Diablo, an assault rifle, she gets an arguably better skill tree compared to Ellie. And the thing that really made me notice this even more is how she gets also the best boss fight in both games, the Rat King. The Rat King's section is by far the best part of the game, and piling up the reasons stated above, in my eyes it feels very manipulative gameplay wise that they want you to like Abby by making her playtime the BETTER part of the game compared to Ellie's.

   Another gripe I have is how they want to mirror Abby by basically giving her Joel's Arc, but I don't think it works because Joel's bond with Ellie grew in a span of many months through a long journey across the US. Abby gets the same treatment by having a responsibility towards Lev, but this is in a span of 2 days in Seattle. I don't buy that she changed her mindset entirely because of them. While I was going through the game I didn't mind it, but the more I thought about, it didn't click with me that Abby can earn the same arc that Joel had in the first game, as I believe their intention is to show Abby as a mirror of Joel from another perspective, but I think it falls flat in my opinion.

 + Abby vs Ellie Theater Boss fight:

   I really dislike how the writer(s) were so sure that we would be totally okay with us fighting Ellie when she has a whole game and a half of bias behind her in comparison with Abby, a character I am biased to dislike despite the lengthy section we just played with her. But honestly, the fight or circumstances themselves don't really bother me, it's the cutscene when Dina shows up.

   Dina gets her faced mashed into the floor by Abby, and holds a knife to her throat, while Ellie wants to keep her out by saying that she's pregnant, Abby's answer to this is to almost slice her through while saying ""Good"". Now, let me be clear that I know Abby has no way of knowing that Ellie didn't want to kill Owen and Mel and especially did not know that she was pregnant, so she would not know that it was a self defense kill. What bothers me is that it sets her likability back massively in my eyes. The whole game Ellie is unsure of her Vendetta and is clearly affected by her actions towards most of Abby's friends, ESPECIALLY Nora and Mel. So when Abby was so willing to kill a pregnant woman, even through rage, I cannot justify that and forgive that. I think that really sets her back a lot and wish they would have approached that differently.

 + Owen's Love Triangle:

   I could expand on why I think this entire thing is worthless, but honestly I hate love triangles out of principle so let's just keep it at that. (Jesse and Dina don't count to me since the game did not strike me as him being a potential rival, he seemed to respect Dina wanting to be with Ellie, even though she's pregnant with his baby)

 + Jesse:

   I love Jesse, mostly because he reminds me of Glenn from The Walking Dead, mostly due to the setting and well... facial features. The reason I hate to put Jesse here is because in hindsight, he's worthless to the story other than providing Dina a baby that's also worth Jack other than to twist the knife of Ellie losing everything after leaving the farm. He could have had any development, and he IS likeable, but the more I think about it, he is worthless to the story and that pisses me off because I do like Jesse despite his character being a cardboard.

+ Dina, Owen, Mel and Romance in general in this game:

   One thing I appreciated from the first game is how a lot of things were said and not shown, and there could be a lot of implication such as the relationship of Tess with Joel or even Bill and Frank. Even Joel's early years in the apocalypse are mostly hinted but build Joel. Dina, Owen, and Mel are love interests that really bug the hell out of me.

   Dina is an okay love interest for Ellie, but I sometimes question their chemistry. I do like most of their scenes together, but having their history kind of a mystery does not work because we see them being affectionate and lovey dovey, which downplays their unseen history and translates it into: Okay, we are together now and there was no build up to get here. This is why we never see Joel or Tess acknowledge this and instead keep it a little vague for players to figure it out, because it is implied. When you show their relationship, especially in a sequel, Ellie just so happens to have Dina as a love interest, and so their chemistry can feel forced at times.

   Mel being a love triangle really bothers me as we are never told why Abby and Owen have broken up if they clearly still have feelings for each other. Mel feels like she is there just to be a cause of conflict between them. In general, it feels like pretty much most of Abby's friends are super underdeveloped and I mostly never cared that they were killed. Owen was MAYBE the only one I kind of liked in Abby's side, but their whole romance shenanigan was worthless to me with Mel in the middle of the two.



 + Mel:

   Mel annoys me so much in so many ways, she has a punchable face, she is a boring and irritating character, and I just can't stand her, I was indifferent towards her death because I really disliked Mel.

   I will also mention that for being a medic, she is by far the most irresponsible mother and I cannot believe that as a doctor, in a world in the verge of extinction of humans, would put not only her life, but also her baby's life in danger for no reason. To justify my criticism, I asked several women, especially those who have had babies themselves, about her decision to go into patrol within her third trimester, and they all criticized her decision. It's stupid, and her being a doctor makes it much more frustrating. It's not brave or girl boss, it's dumb, at that point natural selection was already going to kill her until Ellie got to her first.



 + Tommy and Maria:

   Why...? Why...? Why in God's green earth did you also have to separate them, I get that he's also driven by revenge and that it will tear relationships apart, but my God, none of the characters in the first game get some sort of hopeful ending. They keep twisting the knife by putting every character of the first game in a terrible place, and I loved how hopeful Tommy and Maria were together. But they even ripped that apart, and I really just can't at this point of the story, everything sucks for everyone, and we are going even lower.



+ The ending:

   I was very unsatisfied with the ending, it has no hope for anyone. I disagree with the notion that Abby did not lose anything in her thirst for revenge, as she lost her friends because of it, but she ends up being the new Joel and Ellie with Lev as Ellie broke the cycle of violence. But as the player, what we get as a reward is that our original characters are all in a worse place, and Ellie loses the only thing she had left of Joel, her guitar playing skills, along with Tommy being resentful towards her. I will not accept a ""That's the point of the game"" as an argument, just because it was their intention of showing the grief caused through the cycle of vengeance, it does not justify how terribly it treats characters from a beloved game. My biggest criticism with this game is that it feels like the writers were spiteful towards the characters and just wanted to make their lives miserable. Even with this ending, I still hold the belief that reordering the order of events of the game would have done more of a favor to it story wise. But all of these aspects combined really still bother me...



Conclusion:

   I know I come across really, and I mean, REALLY negative towards this game, but I will let you in a little secret. I still want to play this game again, and I actually like it, despite my many criticisms towards it. One thing I value in videogames more than anything is how much discussion it can surround it, good and negative. This game is very flawed, but it also has given people a lot of value and what is has to say, even though it didn't resonate with me, it resonated with a lot of people in this community, and I can appreciate how much effort was put into this game, and no matter how much I criticize it, there was more love and passion put into this game compared to my criticism towards it. This game made me analyze it, it made me think, and I find that more valuable than a game that turns my brain off. Do I like The Last of Us Part II? Yeah, I do... It may not be the story I wanted, but it's the one they told, and I can appreciate their attempt. I love the combat, I love No Return, and I will go through the story again in NG+, because it's still a fun game, just with a story I dislike, but can appreciate.



tl;dr:



I like the game now! But still find a lot of flaws that I cannot ignore",0,29,1723450174.0
Samurai II: Vengeance,"VR MMORPG ideas involving massive crossovers and different ways on how to use magic, ki and psionics.","Please let me know what you think. I'd love to hear your feedback. \^\^

I do like the idea of VR and I feel a lot of it is not utilized as well as it could be and there's not too many VR MMORPG games. I would like one that is twice the size of Warcraft or The Elder Scrolls 2 Daggerfall

It would involve multiple classes and subclasses to choose but also involve muliclassing similar to how DND works. Obviously they won't get  made since it would involve other franchises and I don't have money anyway. But it's fun to mess around with. xD

Multiple cities from different realms and planets are involved, and it would involve going through one demi plane after another, in multiple cities and regions. It would also involve different planes of existence. I have info on a story I was coming up with, which involves a spawn of Lavos from Chrono Trigger being the main antagonist. More details can be found here.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/chronotrigger/comments/qc442f/spawn\_of\_lavos\_dnd\_homebrew\_crossover\_idea\_updated/](https://www.reddit.com/r/chronotrigger/comments/qc442f/spawn_of_lavos_dnd_homebrew_crossover_idea_updated/)

Whenever someone comes up spell mechanics, it will involves the press of a button, but I feel that if this is VR it should be a little more involved. In DND, there's verbal, somatic and material spells. Some   spells would involve pressing a button but I think some should involve verbal components, where you have to pronounce it correctly through your mic. Somatic spells would involve moving your hands in a certain way and when training, it would show you the directions on how to move your hands while casting. Material spells would just cost certain things in order for it to be cast.

Your whole body can be used, including your feet. Psionics would involve concentration.  Like if you were an Earthbender or Fire Bender of some  kind, in order  to concentrate, you would need to keep something  together. Such as  keeping a force field around the fire so it stays together and it won't  disappear. Ki attacks would involve timing. Such  as if you are charging  up for a ki attack like a Kamehameha or if you  are about to hit someone using your ki, you would press the button at  the right time to do maximum damage

I would feel that this would set apart other games, because it seems  like  no matter what powers you have, it still involves just pressing a button, but it doesn't FEEL different, when it should, as magic is not   the same as psionics or ki or anything. I would also have mounted  combat  if you are on a walking machine, horse, ect. I feel like there's not  enough direct mounted combat.

I also am not a fan of the Fog of War on maps. You know, when you have a   map and it doesn't show the actual city until your close to it. But  what  sense does that make? The map is already charted and if it   involves  multiple factions and races dealing with each other, wouldn't  you have a  map that shows the city? It'd be like if I had a map of  California and  L.A. doesn't appear on the map until I get close to it.  xD The only time  that something may be uncharted is if you are in a  certain realm or in a  dungeon, but there could still be a way to know  where you are going if  you get the right map by someone

I feel that in MMORPGs people are locked in a grid sort of and it  doesn't  involve talking to people much, like in old Final Fantasy  games. There  were no people that had exclamation marks on their heads  or glowed a  certain color. You talked to people and I feel that it  should not be  saved for you in your journal. Rather you would take your  own notes if  you know someone has a quest. And your location in a  quest shouldn't be  labeled. If it is, it feels like you are going along  a grid. It's  convenient but it takes the fun out of exploring and  possibly getting  lost or maybe ending up with another quest. If you get lost you have no  one to blame but yourself. Basically there would be  no hand holding but  it wouldn't be unfair.

As   far as death goes, like in certain games, you should lose everything.   And I mean everything except for quest related items or soulbound items and/or creatures. That way, it would make the bank more useful so that  way you would only take what you need. You can have armor and weapons   bound to your soul so you won't lose it. You do have a chance to recover, but nothing will stop players from obtaining your gold or items  so take what you need. Death should be kind of severe otherwise you wouldn't care how many times you died. There could also be a delivery service that can deliver food or items. Kind of like in the Earthbound game with the Mach Pizza or the Escargo Express, where you pay a fee to   have items delivered to you so you don't have to run to the storage or   bank  and you can have items taken away from you so you won't be so   encumbered.

If  you are in the  major cities, it is considered ""neutral ground"" Meaning  you do NOT  start a fight or try to steal stuff, because the guards will  come after  you and kick your ass most likely. No one starts a fight with  anyone  if they want to live or not be seriously fined, as depending on  your  crime, you may get fined for it or they may take you down. This  way, it  will give players a chance to be safe from high leveled players  who  are more experienced and just want to kill low levels for the fun of   it.

Lastly  I would like if it the  world changed as you played. Like in Everquest  as certain events may  take place because the developer wanted to have  the world go through a  cataclysm or your town was overrun but a certain  faction. That way, the  game would feel more real. So you wouldn't wait  for an expansion for  things to change, it would change as you played it.  I would like it if  you could construct your own houses, boats, or  airships as well.  Basically combine the creativity of Minecraft, with  the Elder Scrolls  action/rpg mechanics and with the intensity of Unreal  Tournament, so  grinding won't be a chore and it would only have a level  20 cap, but if  you need practice, you would fight enemies and it would  be more fun  since every move you make can affect the outcome of the  fight. And it  would be in VR. That would be my idea of a perfect VR  MMORPG.

It would involve multiple races, some of which have sub-races as well. These are the ones I had in mind.

Namekian

Gnome- Deep Gnome, Rock Gnome, Forest Gnome

So think Lu Bu vs Moses, Nobunaga vs King Arthur, or Mary Magdalene vs Sun Tzu. Each hero card has HP, Attack, and Defence. Their skill is based on their lore and story/legend.

Before I sink in time into coding it or making physical cards and boards., I'd like to test out the idea, and gameplay and get feedback on it. I already have the rules, board, and all the sample cards with skills ready. If anyone is interested, I can easily share it and we can set up a time to play it (via call or video call) and test it out. I'm also willing to try out your games as well and give feedback.

Celtic Heroes,Best free2play mmo game?,"After my brother got me into Celtic Heroes this week, I want to try some other mmo games, as I never thought I would enjoy them. There are so many out there and at least some have got to be crap, so can anyone suggest any for an mmo n00b?",1,35,1392212880.0

Celtic Heroes,Can you be the one to suggest an engaging Mobile RPG/MMO?,"I'm on the hunt, and hopefully you are as well, for a great RPG/MMO mobile game which is not driven by the AUTO button. Heck, I don't mind paying for the game or even having advantages for players who do invest...I'm not racing against them - I won't throw a tantrum in chat if I don't get the Living Dragonflesh Body Armor. It would be nice, but whatevs' 

  
For a basic framework of my interests games on PC I have spent the most hours & days playing...who am I kidding – months include:

* Anarchy Online
* Diablo III
* Elder Scrolls
* Everyquest II
* Fallout
* Final Fantasy
* Grim Dawn
* Most of the Star Wars titles (but not Battlefront)
* Path of Exile
* World of Warcraft

 ...you get the idea. 

  
  While not all these games have every thing on this list the things I like about these are: 

* I'm not into heavy PvP, but can join in if I choose
* Crafting
* Gathering
* Exploring
* Distinctive Classes with skill choices to make them different There is more than way to equip your character 

  When it comes to mobile the short list I have tried:

* Castle Clash
* Celtic Heroes – 3D
* Clash of Clans
* Crashlands
* Dungeon Hunter 5
* Eternium
* Heroes of Skyrealm
* Nonstop Knight
* Order & Chaos 2
* Pocket Legends
* Pokemon Go
* Postknight
* RPG Toram Online
* Shop Heroes
* Star Wars: Uprising 

  Most of the mobile games I have found are:

* Idle
* Auto complete fests
* There is one sword, dagger, one leather helm & if you want to use a Shotgun Ax this is the only Shotgun Ax you get
* Everything. Is. A. Grind. Every weapon, every armor piece etc only to make it to 2\*...then 3\*...   
  

Currently my tablet is an older Samsung who they abandoned many years ago (read: they never once sent out an update for it, so it is stuck at Android 4.4.2) & while it runs great for most of the things I want to do with it the struggle is real for the battery & hardware to play most of the modern mobile games for more than an hour sometimes way...way less before the battery is drained, if it is even compatible with a game. 

  
I'm open to either an iOS or Chrome replacement, because my tablet is for videos while on the Stair Master (Gawd, how I have a love/hate relationship with that machine!) & playing games; so any games on either platform are of interest. And, yes, most of these have a fantasy vibe, however this is not a requirement.

Unkilled,What “unkillable” enemy at the beginning of the game is the most satisfying to kill at the end of the game?,"A lot of games expose you early to an enemy that will demolish you in one hit that you seemingly cannot take down more than a couple percent of HP. For me, plowing through black knights in Dark Souls and hunting guardians and lynels in breath of the wild are fun payback activities. Marauders in Doom Eternal also come to mind.

It feels like this idea has so much more potential than is being utilized, and i kinda wish more games made you a zombie or undead of some kind. Just kinda felt like throwing this out into the aether as a shower thought. Would be a cool thing to see more of.

Unkilled,Unique horror game monster behaviors?,"To clarify right off the bat, I'm specifically talking about monsters in horror games that you can't really kill/fight against for most, if not all, of the game. Think the grunts/brutes from Amnesia, Jack Baker from Resident Evil 7, or Slender Man from Slender. The unkillable scary thing that you're powerless to stop, basically.

I'm wanting to know, in your opinion, the most unique behaviors of any unkillable monster you've seen in a horror game. I've been thinking about horror a lot lately, but as I think about my favorite horror games I've noticed that a lot of the monsters act similarly in each one. They generally patrol an area, and then give chase if they spot you. The only games I can think of off the top of my head where the monsters work a little differently are SOMA and Slender. Slender Man just kinda teleports around you as the game desires, which admittedly gets old quick but can be a great way to put the player on edge the first few times it happens. As for SOMA, while a lot of monsters do the ""patrol, give chase if player found"" routine, several of them do have some subtle quirk that makes them more interesting. The Proxies, for instance, are blind but have incredible hearing, which can dramatically change how you interact with the environment.

So, your turn - what's an unkillable monster in a game that behaves differently from other monsters like it?",2,12,1701899412.0
Unkilled,In desperate need of recommendations of a fun game,"I am in need of game recommendations. I’m stuck in  a rut and can’t seem to find anything interesting. 

Likes:
- quests or directions telling me what to do 
- building 
- decorating/furnishing homes
- puzzles

Dislikes: 
- combat
- extreme difficulty 
- farming
- games that just throw you in without any sort of direction as to what you’re supposed to do 

Fave games:
- elder scrolls 4 and 5
- fallout 3, 4, and new Vegas
- house flipper 1 and 2
- unpacking 
- life is strange
- power wash simulator 

Combat and difficulty seem to be the mood killers for me. I want to play a game that’s enjoyable, not something I have to play 10 dozen times to beat a level, or something that necessitates killing something every five seconds. If I must kill things, I want to at least be able to have a decent weapon to do so and not get killed the second I set foot outside of my base. Games with god mode or unkillable cheats are a huge plus,  I’m open to cheats that make this possible. 

I have Xbox series S, Xbox 360, pc, and switch. Any recommendations?

Unkilled,[Spoilers] My strategy for having 3 unkillable followers in Skyrim early and for almost the whole game.,"So this may not be an original strategy but I did come up with it myself without input and thought I would share. 

I have done many play throughs of Skyrim and I have always found myself like everyone else ending up a stealth archer. Its just too fun and too powerful. However I got bored and wanted to force myself out of my comfort zone and went with a destruction/conjure mage. I had picked up several strategies over my many play throughs and I wanted to put them all together coherently and make a mage strong early on, a thing I was worried about. So here is what I did.

First off, immediately start and finish the Dark Brotherhood quest line. Do not kill Cicero and claim him as your follower as soon as you can. I was able to get this done by level 7. The next part of the strategy is to do two separate quest lines but neither can be done until level 10 so you have to do other quests in the meantime. One strong suggestion I have is to do the Molag Bal quest and get his mace. It's easy to find and easy to beat. Give that mace to Cicero! He wields it like a pro and you can also fill up a ton of soul crystals by filling Cicero's inventory with empties. As an enchanter this is over powered. 

Now that you are level 10 Start the Dawnguard quest line. Proceed through until you free Serana. She will follow you forever or until you take her back to her castle. Just don't ever take her back.  You can keep her for the whole rest of the game without doing the finish of that quest line and she will be yours.

Next, we are going to repeat this strategy. Now we start the Blades quest line. From here we progress through the quests until we meet Esbern in the Ratway. He will join your party and follow you along with Cicero and Serana for as long as you never continue through the Blades quest line. I was able to get all 3 at somewhere around level 12 or 13. Very early.

I am a conjuror and so is Esbern and Serana. Along with your 3 followers you also have 3 conjured creatures following along as well.

Who knows, there might be others in Skyrim that follow this pattern that I just haven't found but it is strong and powerful. The only part of the game you can't finish in this configuration is the Dawnguard and the Blades quest lines which is why I say you can do almost the whole game this way... (duh)

Unkilled,Looking for games with similar healing/support playstyle as in wow,"Back in Wotlk healing was my favorite thing be it in raids , dungeons, arena or bgs. Healing in wow is just so unique and interactive for me. Managing CDs mana, having a whole set of tool to deal with different situations. If you played right your team in pvp was unkillable. 

Ever since that I look for similar playstyle in games but nothing come close. I like playing support but in most games I feel limited to a few tools and just not the same. The closest it came to is DoS2 where I made build with every support skill possible and had some kind of tool for every situation. Not even BG3 comes close to this. These are also turn based games. And not really what I'm looking for.

Unkilled,What does your first playthrough of an RPG typically look like?,"Whenever I play a new RPG I'm basically a paladin. My decisions tend to be lawful good, rarely if ever committing crimes unless a major storyline or the most-moral option compels me to, and always choosing the 'friendship is magic' peaceful, free-the-slaves, save-the-puppy, hope for the best options. I also usually go with the heavy armour big weapons warrior archetype, forgoing any spells that aren't healing or damage based in favour of a warhammer or minigun as the setting gives me. 

I've also noticed that my dad more often plays the rogue on his first playthrough, spreading chaos and stealing everything that isn't nailed down while strategizing around the stealth elements and more tactical spells and abilities while still generally aiming for the good ending, and my brother is inevitably a chaotic evil wizard who cares only about dealing the most damage and dealing it to any NPC unlucky enough to not be tagged unkillable.

Unkilled,My vibes-only prediction for ES6,"Bethesda will not listen to fans nor critics and continue in the soulless direction they have been with shallow base building and empty worlds. You will make a home base and pretty it up like in ES5 but it will only have a few shallow customization options, being less customization than FO4 settlements. And you will have to defend it all the time.

The province explored will be all generic roads, hills, and woody areas without personal touches, save for 2 or 3 that sneak past QA. It might even be that you deploy from a base/city and fast travel directly to many/all dungeons, though I admit this observation is my biggest reach.

Elder Scrolls 6 will feature many returning VAs to capitalize on nostalgia, as well as using a superficially modified version of the Creation Engine they've been using for like 14 years. [I bet they will bring the awesome Keith Silverstein (Nazeem) back to voice characters to capitalize on fan memes.]

Skill trees and paths will be simplified, disallowing personal touches for character development. I expect something like the SPECIAL system from FO4 but more simplified, maybe into 9 basic groups, evenly distributed into 3 families: a warrior, mage, and rogue family. With maybe 3-5 skills in each.

More generic/radiant quests. Less faction interaction - all stories only go 1 way. Less factions - maybe 10 in the game code and 3 in the plot. If there is a big ethical dilemma in-universe, it will not be thoroughly explored, and you will simply pick a side and that will be the 'right' side because of your participation.

NPC's will not care/remember you beyond basic story developments. [Ex. You defeat an ogre at the Big City. You are now the Ogreslayer all game, until you defend the Big Church. Now you are the Holy Warrior.] While I do like NPC's recognizing my accomplishments, only generic guards and such will say anything. A warrior faction won't give a rats ass about me being the Ogreslayer, and act like my character just left prison.

You're going to be in prison and escape/be pardoned. Alternatively, my prediction for a twist on prison is that you will be a newbie prison guard. I don't mind at all the recurring 'start in prison' that is basically tradition at this point, tbh. But I imagine many people are going to be tired of it.

Dragons are either going to be shoehorned out of the plot of Elder Scrolls or there will be dozens of side/radiant quests about dragon slaying, with 1 dragon important to the story and they die. There will be no in-between or greater development.

Unique loot like Daedric Artifacts will be leveled again, meaning if you do Daedric quests early, you get the shittiest version of an artifact. Those and maybe 2 story items will be the only unique items until the first DLC.

Some guards, all vendors, children, potential spouses, lords, quest givers, and story characters who die later will be Essential [unkillable]. There will be no 'you killed Robert the Swift, who is part of 2 quests, 1 of which you are currently undertaking. You have failed your quest and the 2nd will never initiate.' Robert the Swift is essentially immortal, unless he is part of a Dark Brotherhood quest, in which case he will be killable when you are told he is.

I'm terrorizing the blonde lady with war paint until she glitches out, stuck in the crawling, mostly prone, half dead position of an unkillable NPC as close to 'death' as they're gonna get.
Cool, i'll just keep roasting her.
Can't bring her to zero, though, cause then she'll just reset.
so i'll just heal her up a bit.

Unkilled,New game to play,"Heya beautiful people! I bought my new pc setup in November 2018; since then, I basically played three games: Shadow of The Tomb Raider, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and Dark Souls 3. I am now looking for a new game to buy and I'm here for some advice.  
Shadow of The Tomb Raider was okay, I liked the problem-solving involved in many challenges you have to face, the story was fine and character personalization mediocre. I put ~40 hours into it.  
TW3:WH was a masterpiece for me: the story was absolutely gorgeous, sidequests were deep and funny, landscapes were amazing; if I may find something I didn't like, it's the fact that the game becomes too much easy even in the hardest difficulty mode and your character becomes basically unkillable with a good build, thing that makes fights less interesting. I put fucking ~140 hours into it and I loved every bit of it. 
DS3 was inspiring and challenging, the combat system was compelling and funny (especially for someone like me who never touched a DS game before), the story was good to live even tho a little too much ""hidden"" for my taste, especially coming from a game like TW3. I put ~70 hours into it.  
Now, what I think I'm looking for is a game with a great story to tell, a lot of character personalization options, a challenging progression, a ghaphic that stays on par with the games I've already played and lots of playability.

Unkilled,The sad but brutal story of Demon King Gele. This story is from the Rance series.,"Note: about the word Maou. It can mean Satan, Demon lord, Demon King etc.

Table of Contents

1. Her past and why did she became the most brutal Demon King to ever live.
2.  The beggening of her Brutal Age.
3. The end of her age.
4. The history of her age.


Her past and why did she became.

When she was Human she was well-known beauty and a renowned philosopher, her wisdom reached out to many people, her intelligence helped those in need and her kindness was known across the land. There were, of course, people that harbored jealous feelings towards this seemingly perfect girl, which is why one day she was attacked by a mob of those that despised her virtues.

She was savagely beaten, raped and tortured. Her face smashed with rocks and sticks, her arms and legs were torn off, her delicate breasts ripped into by stones. After the ordeal she was left on the roadside to die, but by this point her mind was already gone. 

It was the sight of this dying girl that the 4th Demon King in history Nighcisa noticed as he took a stroll across that country road. In the last years of his life, Nighcisa was searching for a heir and it was the sight of the beaten Gele that made him feel pity for a human for the first time. He gave her his blood and turned her into the next Demon King as a result. Before he moved on, Nighcisa had told her about the Hero System and of its workings, that the Hero of the era would gain strength as humanity dies.

2.  The beggening of her Brutal Age.

Ordinarily, the Demon King would feel blood lust naturally, but Gele was mentally broken and warped by the series of events that had unfolded just prior to her transformation. Due to that chain of events, Gele's hatred for humanity was the most intense hatred that could ever have been felt.

In under the span of a year, Gele had wiped out every single nation mankind had established.

Fair skinned, with soft hair and pretty blue eyes, Gele was a girl who could be called faultless, intelligent, incorruptible and beautiful. However after turned into the Demon King she became cunning and brutal, she subjugated mankind to a life of slavery with several well-laid plans. Her knowledge of the Hero System meant that she knew how to foil any chance humanity had against her. Gele did not want to simply kill humans, she decided that she would give the entire race a taste of living hell by making them live as slaves, toys and playthings for the Monsters and Dark Lords. However, she prohibited monsters to kill humans unless it was absolutely necessary. It was done this way to keep humans numbers as high as possible to not be threatened by the Hero System. Because if 50% of all human's are dead then the hero can kill the Maou. 

During her reign no nation could be established, the lucky humans would live in small villages hidden across the land hoping to not get attacked by monsters or Dark Lords. Others would simply be caught and live as the toys of the monsters or forced to a life of slavery until they die of exhaustion or starvation. Nights were silent and dark and going out during such hours was considered suicide even by the bravest warriors.

In order to counter the Hero System, Gele set up thousands of ""Human Farms"" where humans would be bred and kept like livestock, this way the population would never fall to the levels necessary for the Hero to be able to kill her. Captured women would often be sent to the farms to be used for breeding purposes until they die. Sometimes some unlucky humans would be kept as Gele's ""pets"" where their arms, legs and tongue would be mutilated, rendering them completely defenseless, a clear way of causing to humans the same that was done to her.

3. The end of her age.

There were many that tried to take her down, but all their efforts would be futile. As the Demon King, Gele was the most powerful being in The Continent, unmatched by anyone and far beyond humanity's comprehension. Humans were less than insects for her.

However, when the time of her era was drawing close, Gele started to fear death. The Demon King always rules for 1000 years and near the end she started researching different ways to become immortal and rule over mankind forever. From books that a previous Demon King Ssulal had written and left to her successors, Gele learned about the existence of Supreme God Planner. She gained an audience with Planner, and requested to be the Demon King for eternity. Planner granted her wish and she became an unkillable immortal but the price she payed was that she was extremely weakened to only 5% of her full strength. There was a Dark Lord named Gi that served Gele and was her personal lover. However, Gi had split personality disorder, and his chaotic personality saw her weakened state as an opportunity to take her down. Certain factors allowed him to go against the Demon King's blood control ability and in the year GL1004 he betrayed Gele and used the Demonic Sword Chaos to pierce her heart. Due to her request to Planner, Gele was unkillable but Gi managed to seal her in a dark and empty dimension between space and time, where she would live for eternity as the Demon King, with nothing to rule. It's worth to note that, while Gele was a ruthless and cruel monster, she did truly love Gi and was legitimately heart-broken by his betrayal, and she spent the next millennium incapable of comprehending why he would act against her.

4. The history of her age.

In the Rance world caled the ""continent"" the year is determined by what Demon King in alive during that time. Example: if Gele was Demon King for 50 years then the year is GL0050 or if Gele is Demon King for 250 years then the year is GL250 etc 

GL0001 - Gele inherits Nighcisa's blood and becomes the new Demon King.

GL0002 - Every human nation was wiped out and humanity was enslaved.

GL???? - The Hero can't do anything as Demon King Gele had been warned about the system and subsequently created human farms to keep human population at an all time high.

GL???? - 2nd Class God La Vaswald is destroyed by Supreme God Roven-Pan and divided into two Dark Lords (La Hawzel and La Saizel) by Supreme God Planner. They pledge their service to Gele.

GL???? - A group conformed of five incredibly talented and strong humans form the mightiest party in the history of humanity. They are called the Legendary Five. They set on a journey to find a way to break the invincibility field and defeat Gele.

GL0533 - The Legendary Five enter in the Ancient Ruins. They are never seen again. The first weapons capable of killing Dark Lords, Chaos and Nikkou, are created.

GL???? - Wielding the Demonic Sword Chaos, a powerful spellblader named Gi appears to challenge Demon King Gele. His split personality surfaces mid-battle and Gele uses this chance to convert Gi into a Dark Lord. Gele falls in love with him and he becomes her lover.

GL???? - Gele gains an audience with Planner. She requests to be the Demon King forever. Gele becomes an unkillable immortal, but her power is greatly reduced to only 5% of her former strength.

GL1000 - The Demon King War. Supreme Dark Lord Gi wages war on Gele after learning she has made arrangements to live as an eternal Demon King, taking advantage of her weakened state.

GL1004 - Gi and Chaos manage to seal Gele away into an empty dimension. Gi is bathed in so much of Gele's blood after piercing her heart that he becomes the newDemon King.",2,1,1622972689.0

Unkilled,Why is weapon degradation so unrealistic in most survival games?,"See Dead Island or Dying Light as best examples.  


I DO get that because of the nature of the game, the devs are trying to make the game even more tense and they want to limit the players in how much combat can they get into without any serious consequences, and to emphasize the importance of gathering stuff. I get that it's there to make the scene more tense, but just because how unrealistic it is, it makes the game worse and breaks the immersion. Sure, a 4x4 wooden plank or a broom handle, or some aluminium pipes WILL break after a few well-placed full-power swings to someone's head, but, for Christ's sake, a heavy metal wrench or a sturdy, thick metal pipe or the likes won't.   


When I was a kid, I liked demolishing things (as many kids to like creating mayhem) and I did hit things with wrenches, hammers, pipes, whatever I had when we had to tear down some old stuff, and let me tell you, even without proper qualification: the above-mentioned things are sturdy. A wrench or hammer survived me tearing half a car down with it, with minor scratches. It's really like the devs haven't used any of these tools at all. And, as said, it breaks the immersion and makes the game frustrating.  


If the devs want us to avoid the enemies, make them tougher, maybe unkillable in the beginning, or use some more clever and intuitive restrictions on the player (in case of zombie games, if the player gets bitten, it's over/have to get a VERY rare antivenom or something), but not something so unrealistic.",3,4,1540849495.0
Unkilled,[UnpopularOpinion] Call of Duty Modern Warfare is going to sucks,"The new Call of Duty Modern Warfare revealed today that it will be release in October 25, However for the past 2 games from Infinity Ward it shown that they've lose the capability to make a game that is good enough to live up to the standard of the original, both game are mediocre at best and the gameplay is restrictive and not fun.

Now the new Call of Duty game that will be release this year have a name identical to the good old CoD game which is appalling considering they can name it anything, ANYTHING whether a generic Name-Number or something more creative, anything, instead they went for the same name as the old game.

Campaign wise we know that they ""rework"" the campaign story and a few character to make it fit the current time period, it will not be a continuation of the original CoDMW trilogy, in another word they want this to be the new Modern Warfare by disregarding the old one and replace it with the new one, to me I'm okay with them making their own storyline, I'm okay with the storyline set in a modern period but there is no reason for them to name it Modern Warfare, we already have Modern Warfare, the only reason left for the name is marketing reason.

Campaign story itself is going to show the ""grueling"" and the ""brutality"" side of war, reflects the current time politic and deep story and character development and an ""impactful"" story and narration, what's so bad about it? there is nothing wrong with the old CoD where you played as one soldier fighting one war, nobody ask the game to teach players about morality, nobody ask the game the enlighten about the reality of wars, All the players want is a simple shooting game where the story make sense and not trying to shove every emotion down the players's throat or going woke in politic agenda.

Overall I've felt mixed with the latest CoD reveal, I was one of those player who still buy the new CoD game every year and would hope that someday it will start steer away from being too complicated and too on-rail with the gameplay, not regretting it though as I brought on discount and will always buy it on discount considering this franchise have lost it ""unkillable"" status and the latest game it release kept having a discount sale as people are getting bored with the game faster as more game release. This game currently show no sign of change either, it does not matter what story or time period it's in, if the gameplay is boring, people will not play it.",0,22,1559246539.0
Unkilled,"Mass Effect 3 is a Good Game With a Bad Ending, Not an Overall Bad Game....","So I finished the Mass Effect remakes finally and let me say, Mass Effect are neigh perfect games and it's a shame that Bioware may never be able to create great games like these anymore due to overbearing publishers (cough...EA...cough), terrible and unwanted political messaging, and a growing sense of superiority as a storytelling and RPG game's studio.

However going back to Mass Effect 3 and looking through previous reviews and judgments on the game (myself included) this game is not the terrible disappointment we all thought it to be in our emotional and overly-critical response of particularly it's ending.

The ending is disappointing I agree, and the ""Destroy The Reapers"" ending is the only true canon ending for most fans and for good reason. And the lack of outcome due to your choices previous to it were mostly thrown into the final battle, not the ending, which ultimately made the ending itself feel like another choice rather than a result of your previous choices throughout all of the games.

However this does and SHOULD NOT overshadow the rest of this wonderful game as it is the first and only game TO THIS DAY, that gives a sense of a Galaxy-Encompassing war and a truly apocalyptical struggle against horrors of an almost Lovecraftian horror. The opening is the strongest in any of the games and immediately shows you that this is no longer an isolated problem to Shepard and humanity as you fight in the initial invasion of Earth and then fight, while bearing witness to Paladin's destruction on Paladin's moon. This is the most underrated part of this game and should be the source of inspiration for other games looking to have a war on such a ""world-ending"" scale into he future, as it's sheer presentation and emersion is second to none in this regard.

Then comes the traveling to other worlds, seeing the results, fears, worries, and anger from other life yet untouched by the disaster. I'll never forget seeing Wrex unite his people as you fight to rid the Krogan of the Genesis, or the sheer destruction of the once ""Gem"" of the Galaxy as the Asari capital is in ruins. All while you meet and fight alongside your friends and allies along your journey, comforting them as they return to their homes to find them ablaze.

The Gameplay should not be underrated either, it's simply the best. While not as fluid as Andromeda's it is charming and engaging, never leaving you feeling like you're a bio-god like in Andromeda, but neither less-than-prepared as can be found in Mass Effect 1, you feel like a soldier, and one that has experienced many battles and wars yet is neither unkillable or overpowered. Abilities feel more fluid and the weapons have some kick to them, while also feeling so satsfying to unload a mag into a ""Reaper-Turian"". The Biotics feel fair, while more powerful, with you able to defeat waves of the common footsoldiers with ease yet having to resort to more focused biotics or weapons for the bosses and/or minibosses. There's a reason the wave-fighting multiplayer matches are still played, and continue to be played regularly.

The artstyle of Mass Effect really hit it's peak her too, where in Andromeda things felt floaty and too ""new-aged"" 3 gave that classic artstyle some polish while still keeping the rugged-futuristic blocky minimalist tone, making the colors pop and the environments feel more natural for a Galaxy in the future yet preserving some of the natural beauty of worlds, even as they burn.

In short I can't stress how good this game is and my disappointment in myself and others for jumping the hate-bandwagon too fast on the ending. And while it does not improve the ending, the game as a whole is great when you start looking at the whole picture and not just the particularly bad end, and will always have a place on my top 10 best video games of all time. (I'm torn weather Mass Effect 2 or 3 is the best, 2 is probably the better game but 3 has a kind of charm to it I have really learned to love plus I'm not gay but the Garrus relationship is on of the best in the series here, with the citadel DLC being my favorite expansion purely to see Garrus dance and attempt to have a normal flirting conversation.

Unkilled,Matchmaking vs. Servers,"So the more and more I wander the internet and forums, the more I see that people prefer a server browser of sorts. But I think matchmaking is just as crucial of a multiplayer component as a server browser and I enjoy matchmaking a bit more. I go back to old multiplayer games quite often where there are only server browsers and while the control is very nice, there’s always some worrying factors. 

My first concern is ping. To this day, I have never found a server in any game that had an accurate read on what my ping would actually be. The server says 30 ping, I actually get 50-60. Another concern I have is the players in-game itself. It’s nearly impossible to get into a server of any game and everyone in it has a consistent ping. I understand how hard for some people it must be to get a good internet connection, I had to deal with a shitty one for most of my life, but it’s just not fun playing against a player who is lagging and I’m sure it’s not fun to be the one who is lagging. I’m sure this is a problem for every game but I notice it a lot more with games with server browsers. It really takes me out of it when I can’t kill the guy who’s moving around as a slideshow of pictures sliding across my screen. It’s very noticeable in old Call of Duty games, like incredibly hard to ignore. 

My other concern and it’s just my opinion because I know other people don’t nearly care about it as much as I do and that is okay but my problems with sweats. “Just get gud.” I get that argument, I really do. But here’s an argument. I am “gud” but there is always someone who will be better. I play primarily casually and for fun and I just happen to be competent for the most part at most games due to how long I’ve been playing them for. I don’t usually have a problem with sweats. If someone is better than me then they usually are but oh my god it’s so discouraging to play some games and Mr. I haven’t gotten off this game in 15 years keeps killing me. Then mix this with a bad ping connection and it’s a recipe for disaster. There have been times where I get this awesome concoction and games become to the point where they are unplayable. How am I supposed to kill the unkillable? Well, I don’t. I usually give up before it escalates any further. “Well join another server,” you might say. For some games that isn’t an option. There may only be a handful of servers that have actual players but I do join other servers if available and I do have fun but I can’t help but to think. 

Anyways, matchmaking may be more restrictive but man I love being in lobbies where everyone else and I can have a good connection. SBMM is annoying but I understand the appeal and think that it’s actually okay if done right. If SBMM was way less restrictive and based more on connection then I think it would be perfect. I think games should have skill levels of all kind but there is a limit. I’m sure not everyone wants to go against people who pretends that every game is an E-League Championship and I’m sure not everyone wants to go up against people who bought Battlefield because they thought it was a movie. I think there’s a place for both a server browser and matchmaking and I feel that more games should incorporate both. Albeit if it’s done right. What are your guys’ thoughts? Thanks for coming to my TED Talk btw.

Unkilled,I need the kind of help I really only trust Reddit with re: FALLOUT 3. ,"Please please please no spoilers.  I have 100 lady boners for this game and I'm not even a chick.  I never thought anything would beat deus ex in terms of ""do it how you want"" - GTA was just as fun, but dumbed down.  So anyway, the only ""fault"" of this game is that there's no /ooc ... it's otherwise convinced me I'm in a massive world, and I'm used to playing with others around.

I'm too terrified to go on the wiki for fear I'll click through and spoil something.  For the same reason, I don't want to google or check IGN or anything for answers to some questions.

**TL, DR**  I'm ultra-weary of spoilers, but I have some basic questions.

So please, answer as succinctly as possible:

1.  Do things on the ground ever de-spawn? Like if I drop something because I'm carrying too much, will it always be there later?  Do NPCs mess with my stuff, either by moving it or taking it?  If no to all, can I pick a room or a place and make it my own, storing all my extra weapons there? I can't carry everything, obviously.  I'm experimenting with a locked desk in Megaton that I have a key for...I'm sure you know the one (in the water processing plant).

2.  I heard children are unkillable.  Is there a mod to make that otherwise?  I heard there was maybe 2 years ago when it came out.  Will it corrupt my game?

3.  How is the distance of a thrown incendiary changed?  Holding right-click or gaining strength?

4.  Is there anyway to pass time quickly other than fast travel and sleep? I always finish a quest in the middle of the night and then end up unable to meet with NPCs.  Everytime I fast travel, I realize that I have ADD and I end up doing a million things other than what I was supposed to be doing, like returning...

5.  If I purchase the Rock-It launcher, will that device (assuming I can construct it) allow me to fire the mini-nuke? 

6.  In my random wandering, I found a UFO and an alien blaster.  It came with 120 shots.  I can tell you what I used each shot for; I assume I will never replace it as it's so obviously rare.  I don't want to know if there is another UFO or a way to synthesize the alien tech, but I do want to know if there is anything more powerful than the alien blaster.  Just a yes/no.

Unkilled,"For people whose first experience with Elder Scrolls was through Skyrim, have you tried Morrowind?","Well I'm old and I remember back in the day when I subscribed to Game Informer and they had a review of Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. It looked cool so I picked it up. To this day, it remains my favorite game of all time, even higher than LoZ: Ocarina of Time and GTA: San Andreas.

Wow was there a world to explore. It's absolutely impossible to detail all there is to see, read, hear, and do. In the unexpanded game there are 10 factions where you can climb to the top. You can even join a vampire faction but I usually didn't mess around with vampirism. In the second DLC you can even become a werewolf! 

In the three-way struggle for influence and affluence, you will side with a Great House, the Fighters/Mages/Thieves Guild, and either 1 or 2 additional factions for fun and profit.

The game gives a great sense of scaling power, because at first when your weapon, athletics, acrobatics, magic, and armor skills are low, you won't be able to hit the broad side of a netch. But give it a few levels, really especially level 7-10 or so and you will become essentially invincible. There are also treasures to seek and actual motivation to go spelunking in the many well designed caves, not just for Skyrim's radiant quest reward of 150 gold or whatever, but in Morrowind perhaps a unique artifact to either keep or sell to the museum.

Skyrim seems so *sanitized* and somewhat *dumbed down.* All the doors are quest locked (I **hate** quest locked doors), there are unkillable NPCs (in Morrowind there were ""essential"" NPCs but you could kill them and take the back road to complete the main quest, since the regular main quest is probably broken now), leveled loot which means it sucks no matter what level you are, caves and dungeons that are way too big that you can't even warp out of but they have that backdoor crap which to me is not realistic at all, there are no more attributes so I can't even raise intelligence or strength which means it's not really an RPG. Maybe the RPG element is that you can choose how many radiant quests to do, who to marry, not that it matters, who to pick in the civil war which also doesn't matter, and then just keep going on rails from point A to point B where part of the challenge is trying to stay awake going up that stupid mountain. 

Also fast travel where you click on a map marker is totally bogus. In Morrowind you better have the network learned for silt striders/mage teleporters/boats/propyon indices. And Skyrim found a way to fuck up the prisoner tradition. In Morrowind you are trying to prove yourself as the reincarnation of a fallen hero. And people tell you different answers. It's fucking subtle and interesting. A wise woman of a tribe says you are not the hero but could become him, others tell you that you are him, the hero had a relic that only he could wear and you can wear it, and so on.

Unkilled,"IMO Black Ops 2 Multiplayer is the most balanced, and well designed experience since MW2, and may even be more so - does the bandwagoning of nerd-hate on an otherwise great game bother anyone else? ","**Briefly:** I've spent literally weeks of game time playing the multiplayer in each of the MW era games (except world at war). I spend most of my time in Hardcore TDM/SD/HQ etc. though I *have* played a decent amount of Core game time so I could play with those who like that better.

**So this is how I see COD Multiplayer:** Unlike Halo (or the older style Unreal Tournament or Quake type deathmatch) there is ideally no trump card in any one encounter. The maps, weapons, perks, and killstreaks are nominally designed so that while they tip the scales, there are always strategies and skills you can develop to rebalance the game. Being a level 10 prestige doesn't automatically make you a great player, nor unkillable. 

**Why Blackops 2 is good:** The weapons are balanced really well, like any game there seems to be issues with a couple weapons (the starting sniper rifle is extremely easy to use, and no-scope with), but overall everything feels well-rounded. The levels are largely well designed, meaning there aren't whole sections of most of the maps where a team can control with impunity, and they flow well. The sound design is great, which is important for everything from knowing what kind of gone is shooting at you, to knowing what kill streaks are in the air. The killstreaks are powerful, and reward what they're supposed to reward (teamwork, patience, not camping) but they're not a ""kill everyone on the map"" switch like many of the kill streaks were in MW3, Blackops and  Mw2. Lastly the ""Pick 10"" system is awesome, it's fun, and it lends balance while letting you play how you play. It seems obvious when you read about it, but actually deciding wether you can sacrifice your grenades for an extra attachment takes time, and work, and makes you keenly aware of each perk's positives and negatives.

**TL;DR : Black Ops 2 is a great game, all COD multiplayer can be a really rewarding experience, so why all the hate?**",0,4,1353389442.0
Unkilled,The EA hate train,"I'm probably gonna get downvoted into hell for this because I've never seen reddit hate a game as much as BF2, but what the hell.

BF2 is a good game. It's beautiful, the gameplay is unique and it does really feel like star wars, even if the jedi are cross-era.

It seems people love to cry about how it is ""pay-to-win"". Yes, there are cards and heros and such that you can buy with money, but since they reduced the price it's a lot easier to grind for them. Remember, no game is completely finalized and the public will sway developers to patch certain things (including stirring up a shitstorm to do so). Microtransactions exist in SO many games today, it baffles me as to why EA games are so targeted by the community for them.

Even without earning the cards or heroes they are not massively unbalanced. Overextending as any hero or tank will get you killed rapidly, and cards only give a very small edge over someone else, easily correctable by superior skill. The game rewards players with better aim and positioning, jedi aren't gods and can be taken down with some level of teamwork.

People also love to cry about BF1. Yes, it was an ass-cheeks game, with a terrible jedi system. But that doesn't mean BF2 is doomed to be trash too. Just because it's EA doesn't automatically brand a game as a money-whoring shit hole that is unfun. It doesn't sit well with me that the developers at DICE worked this hard on a new game, trying so much to improve it from BF1, only for people to shit on the game solely because it is EA. 

It's true that some of the maps are terrible and have choke points that are practically impossible to get through. But complaining about it actually does help and they're probably going to have some updates to change the maps. 

BF2 isn't a recycled Overwatch or COD. At worst, it combines the elements of other AAA games into one, like PUBG's large scale, class shooters like TF2, etc. Even if the main game mode does not work for you, there are several of them so you can choose your liking. The most important thing to me is that BF2 feels like its own game, and I don't get people who say EA is just ""using the star wars name"" for money.

Lastly I really don't get why cross-era jedi is bad. Who doesn't want to see rey fighting the emperor? There's new possibilities unlocked instead of the same boring old match-ups.
""MUH ImMerSion"" BabyRage

Edit: Seems the largest gripe is with ""Pay2win"" or ""centered"" around microtransactions. I don't think this is the case. Pay2win means you can pay to become an unkillable OP god. In BF2 you can be a wallet warrior but in the end what do you get? Some more heroes and a few cards which will give you a small edge. It doesn't break the game and you can outplay them if you have enough skill to do so. Yes, they did lower the campaign reward to 5000 but didn't change the pvp match rewards. 
If you complain about the grind that's basically what games are designed for. If you start out with everyone unlocked then there's really nothing to strive for and it gets old fast, which is why games like LOL design it like that. 
After you get your first hero for each side, which does not take ""40 hours of gameplay"" anymore, you're basically set.

tl;dr If it was a shit game before it isn't anymore. Prices have changed and there is less grind. People focus too much on the ability to pay for a small edge and too little on how fun the game is.

Unkilled,"So, Who Actually Liked Stalker: Call Of Pripyat?","I thought it was just horrible. 

This is my experience with the game:

<rant>
So, you start after being dropped out of the sky into the field with a useless pistol, useless assault rifle, and the best weapon in the game: the knife. There's no introduction or tutorial, so you have to go and see the button configs yourself. The game directs you to a helicopter crash site, which you run to at superhuman speed, but it's up a small hill, so you can't get to it. So you go see a NPC who asks you to come help him kill some monsters. He teleports you... somewhere. You don't have to kill any monsters, you just jump off a cliff, and then teleport again. That brings you to the top of the small hill where the helicopter is. After checking the crash site, you run to the local safe settlement, which is filled with talking statues. They speak frat boy. You talk to one of the statues and grab a side quest. Mine was to find a container in a car, in a cave. So I go to the cave, get the container, then kill a bunch of hilarious looking, horribly animated, ""snooks""?. You kill them with the knife, because it's the only weapon that does the job. Then you walk outside, run back to the settlement, then split up the loot. You ask for another side quest, which is to clear out a ""bloodsucker"" nest. You run there at 100 mph, killing a couple of pigoons on the way with your knife. You get there, and the worst actor ever is there to greet you. He says the blood suckers are inside a small building, so you go inside, and kill them all with your knife by running after them at 100 mph or sitting in a corner and killing them one by one. During the side quest, you collect a bunch of dropped weapons. Making your way back to the settlement, you think: Nice! I can sell these for some $$$! But when you get back, you need to find someone to repair them for you. That takes forever, because he's a loner who sits in the back of one of the dorm rooms and demands booze. Anyway, you make no money on the guns because it cost so much to repair them. Then you get another side quest, which is to try to get into an abandoned ship covered in flying unkillable invisible magnifying glasses which kill you. 

This all takes place in a brown, and (unless there's a lightning storm) boring swamp. The game engine will also stutter every couple of minutes. Animations are totally unnatural. The characters are uninteresting. The story is a joke. The enemies are either too easy or way too hard. Gameplay is both uninteresting and confusing.

Unkilled,Final Fantasy X/X2 HD remastered questions,"Final Fantasy X is, still to this day, the only game to have defeated me. The crushing blow this game delivered to my ego has stuck with me all these years. It forms the very foundations of my gaming experience. The built in skepticism that I now play every game with, it all started here. With Final Fantasy X and the infinite loop that made me never pick up another Final Fantasy again.

Let me explain. The year was 2002, and being the experienced Final Fantasy ""Veteran"" of my group of friends this game was just simply a must. I spent countless nights plowing through this game abandoning all sleep and nourishment. I loved it. I wasn't even finished with it yet, and was already declaring it proudly as the new #1 in my personal ""best games ever"" list. Then, almost without warning, I boarded an airship, saved my game, and was forced to fight Guardian Wyrm Evrae almost immediately. I had made an error. A crucial mistake somewhere in my journey. This boss was simply unconquerable. No matter what changes I made, my party fell to this hideous wyrm every time. I had only used one save, not multiple. So the only save game I had was right before the fight. Nothing I could do would work. I was defeated. Yuna and the entire world, lost forever. This gave me two choices. Restart the game from the beginning, or concede defeat and walk away. I'm not proud to say that I chose the latter. I have not played a single Final Fantasy game since. This game, and its infinite loop of Wyrm death, turned me away from a franchise that I had played literally since #1. 

Today, I return. For vengeance, for glory, for Yuna, and for completion. I have just dropped $29.99 for ffx/x2 hd remastered on ps3, and now I have some questions. So that this time I might succeed.

- Firstly, it was my understanding from friends years ago, that the crucial mistake I made is that there is a simple trick to insta kill this boss by tossing a phoenix down on him. I think that might be the undead version though? It has been so many years. I really have no clue.

- If my mistake is not missing this simple trick, where could I have gone wrong? Why was I stuck in this loop? Why was the Guardian Wyrm Evrae so unkillable for my party, no matter what I did?

- Because I never completed X and subsequently walked away from all FF, what is X2 like? As the first ever direct sequel it sure would have a lot to live up to.

- What's the remastered version like? Have I just let nostalgia and hurt pride steal $30 from me? Or am I going to love this all over again? 

I realize this is a bit long for an /r/gaming post, but this game truly affected me deeply. I loved it. The story was one of the best ever, and it has been my goal for over a decade now to come back and complete this game. Any help or insight on my young mistake or information about others who also got stuck in a loop at the Guardian Wyrm Evrae, is greatly appreciated. 

Thank you in advance!",5,4,1431992821.0

Unkilled,Everyone missed the FIRST reference in SW: Battlefront 2... and it's a Disney movie,"&#x200B;

[Iden Versio and VZ-626](https://preview.redd.it/vq4akjayg2q11.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8a03a795703d23bda17266bb31d7f7efcbfb861)

So I have searched google and I did some VERY brief searches on reddit/youtube, and I can't find anything about this. I REALLY hope I'm not being too presumptuous to claim that I am the first one to find this obvious (to me) reference in a game made last year... It is in the OPENING campaign cinematic, last chance to find it yourself.

Here we go...So you know it's Disney now. Did you catch it? I'm going to give a few more hints that also acts as evidence that this is not a coincidence.

* ""Monstrosity? What you see before you is the first of a new species""...
* ""He is fire-proof,
* bullet-proof,
* and can think faster than super computer.
* He can see in the dark, and move  objects three thousand times his size.
* His only instinct... to destroy  everything he touches!""**And to make it obvious**
* ""*Grand Councilwoman:* So it *is* a monster.*Jumba:* Eh, just a little one.""

That's right.... PROTAGONIST DROID VZ-626 is in fact a homage to the species of Experiment-626 AKA STITCH!

* We've never seen this droid type before (new species)
* Safe to assume this droid can take a beating considering its for spec ops and hangs off the characters back like a backplate.
* It can DEFINITELY deflect bullets considering its a world that has evolved to lasers.
* Can think faster than a super computer (necessary to overpower and hack so many systems""
* It can definitely see in the dark... Hell it see's through walls.
* Upon activation the droid immediately comes to life, attacking anyone it comes across before they even know what hit em, and fucking up every computer/system you can find along the way. Unlocking doors, causing mayhem.
* It's just a little droid...

Given these similarities, the designation 626, and the fact that star wars is owned by Disney. We've all seen em. They are putting references in practically everything. My favorite is Yondu(whistling red arrow mohawk guy) being compared to Mary Poppins in GOTG2 lol. This one is simply much more subtle, yet its staring you in the face if you are a wierdo like me that remembers things like Experiment 626 or ladiesman217 like people remember order66. So when I heard ""activate VZ-626"" and it flashed on the screen for a brief second, my nerdy senses began to tingle.

This was really cool for me. I know this games squat, I got a free game at redbox and this was all they had, or I wouldn't have played. But I was literally restarting the game 3-5 times while broadcasting(lost all my viewers attention instantly lmao) just to figure out, and then confirm my nerdy excitement. If everyone else already knew this WHY DIDN'T ANYONE SAY ANYTHING BY NOW?! I'm sorry if this is old news. No one told me about it, and I couldn't find anything with stitch/droid/626/reference in anything. So I will make it up to you with another theory/reference/belief that relates to this one that I've never seen mentioned by anyone to me atleast...

***TLDR; Its Stitch from Lilo and Stitch (originally named experiment 626)***

&#x200B;

So whats the bonus I have to throw at you guys? In a way, it is a Deadpool reference in a way and here is why... Stitch is based on/inspired/in some way connected... Yup, Stitch is Disneys version of deadpool.

* Teaser trailers feature stitch breaking into the stories of disney and pissing them off and climbing over and into another, from beauty and the beast, to the little mermaid. He's breaking 4th walls and into stories that have nothing to do with him.
* A poster for the movie shows a bunch of Disney classics looking down at him in disgust. All the marvel characters have to tolerate and dread the presence of deadpool. No one wants him around, just like these characters.
* Stitch was created in a laboratory as an experiment. So was DP
* Stitch is unpredictable, unstable/crazy, overpowered, almost unkillable, and thoroughly enjoys chaos even if its as small as taking away your left shoe. DP is ...seriously? Its DP, this one's obvious.
* Both can get run over by a truck and survive.

So as far as I am concerned, Stitch was inspired by/based on Deadpool. He is Disney's Deadpool from back when Disney didn't own Marvel. Which means that VZ-626 gives reference to Stitch. So if Stitch is based on Deadpool, in a way... you are also referring to deadpool.

Discussion point:I think VZ in VZ-626 is simply because it's owners last name is Versio named it such to designate it as hers. But at first I considered it a part of a reference I'm missing. I wouldn't be surprised to find out its also special. Perhaps the initials of a director or writer for Stitch? Thoughts?

&#x200B;

Anyways thanks for reading. This is prolly the most effort I've ever put into a post on this site. I hope I made it endurable and education as well as entertaining. If you got this far, I hope it's not too bold of me to mention that you can always hear me ramble more on [Mixer@RisenFallacy](mailto:Mixer@RisenFallacy).

Unkilled,My honest review of my first few hours of Amnesia: The Dark Descent.,"Okay, let me start this off by saying that I think this might not be my kind of game. I've read tons of reviews on how awesome the game is, how great the atmosphere is, and how it can cause you to shit yourself with fear. Perhaps it overhyped itself, I don't know, but here's a recollection of my first few hours playing this game without going into too much detail on the plot or progression itself.

One of the first things I notice about the game is that you're constantly surrounded by strange sounds. Breathing, heartbeats, gasps, footsteps that aren't yours, wind, crawling bugs, rustling leaves. I understand it's about creating a tense environment, but seriously these sounds never shut up. Strange whispers, footsteps, and unidentifiable screams are far less frightening or startling when you hear them every ten seconds or so. Despite being intended to make for a creepy and foreboding environment, it instead makes you feel like someone's following you around with a ""spooky Halloween"" soundboard and a mainline of pure caffeine. 

The visual atmosphere is very well done. The shading and lighting effects are very impressive, and the darkness feels almost suffocating at times. The motion blur effect when you quickly whip your head around to look behind you is just disorienting enough to add to the anxiety without being a hindrance, and the very slow fluxing and waving of the screen adds an alien, otherworldly feel to the environment as a whole.

At its core, Amnesia is basically just a physics puzzle game similar to the non-combat parts of Half-Life 2. You have to find keys and other items to move on to the next part of the game, which requires you to do a little exploring combined with some physics manipulation. Unfortunately, a lot of that is hindered by some of the more quirky aspects of the game.

For starters, your character has a ""sanity meter"", which itself wouldn't be so bad except for the fact that the whole ""sanity"" aspect of the game has been turned into nothing more than a contrived method for adding needless complexity to the game. Your character's sanity level drops when he's in the shadows, which is hilarious because I don't think darkness has threatened *my* sanity since I was eight years old. I would think that the random screams, whispers and unexplained voices were a far bigger threat than the inability to see the ground immediately beneath your feet. And let me be clear here, it's not pitch blackness that drives your character insane, it's being in the shadows, even if there's daylight a mere thirty feet away.

Another aspect to the sanity system is that staring at monsters causes your sanity to drop. Apparently, you're just never able to get over that initial shock of spotting a creature thumping through the corridors. Even after evading half a dozen of these things, my character still started pissing himself simply by watching one from fifty yards away while completely hidden. The sanity system gives the feeling that the creators, afraid to put too *many* monsters in the game, needed to make the shadows themselves an enemy to avoid.

As for the scare factor, I didn't find there to be much of one. As I mentioned earlier, maybe it was just too hyped up by the time I played it, or maybe it's because I was never *expecting* to find a monster behind every closed door. Even when I was able to immerse myself in the game with headphones and all of the lights off (which I did for my entire playthrough), the monster appearances were lackluster at best. I caught a glimpse of the first monster walking into a doorway and didn't feel any urge to immediately run away, but instead wanted to get a closer look, only to be disappointed when the monster had somehow vanished before I got there. There were a few jump scares that managed to startle me, such as when an object I picked up triggered a cave-in or random voice (damn those load-bearing tinderboxes!), or when I'd turn around and there was a monster right behind me, but it was more shock at seeing something I didn't expect than being terrified in any way. I wasn't fleeing in abject terror, I was fleeing because I had no means of defending myself. More of a strategic withdrawal than anything.

I guess that's part of what ruined it for me. I spent the game surrounded by items that could be used as weapons such as hammers, saw blades, chairs, rocks, and an assortment of other potentially lethal implements, yet under the restriction that I'm not *allowed* to fight any of these monsters. It was a constant reminder that there was always a way to avoid or outwit them, but with the loss of sanity for attempting to be stealthy and stick to the shadows, I kept feeling like the solution had already been wrought and I was required to either solve the puzzle their way or not at all.

Overall, Amnesia is a very well-made game where it does shine. The environment is incredible, spooky and very well done. The engine does an excellent job of providing immersion, and the setting keeps you guessing. The sound is good for what it's worth, though the frequency of the unexplainable sounds tends to detract from the overall experience. The lack of weapons and sanity system makes it feel like the game is trying too hard to make you avoid things, as if a creepy environment, unkillable monsters and well-built puzzles weren't alone enough to make for a good game.

I'll probably finish it since I did pay for it and I enjoy puzzle games, but I don't think it's ever going to really scare me or keep me up at night like some reviewers have reported.

**TL;DR** - Wasn't as scary as I'd hoped, but had redeeming qualities. (See how useless a TL;DR is on a full review? That's why you read the summary at the end...)",1,6,1303876203.0
Unkilled,Dead Space 2: Ten Years Later,"I originally posted this on PSNProfiles.com but wanted to share it here as well.


It's a good time to be a Dead Space fan. EA recently announced their remake of the first game, which plans to incorporate cut content from the original, and Gunner Wright returning to finally give a voice to Isaac in the first game. It's still very early in development, but what we've seen so far looks incredible. EA Motive promises to stay true to the original story and spirit of the game while bringing it up to modern standards. 
 

I originally intended to write this piece on January 25th, which was the actual anniversary of Dead Space 2, but things came up and I never actually got around to it. Now that Halloween is on the way, I figured I would finally get to it. For clarification purposes this not a review. This is more of a retrospective, my thoughts on the game as they developed over the last ten years.

 
Improve But Don't Forget

 
If you read my review of the game, you know that I consider it to be a bona fide masterpiece. And I still do. Dead Space 2 accomplished what many developers want but rarely achieve; it managed to surpass and improve on its predecessor in almost every way imaginable, while still creating an identity of its own. Dead Space 2 encompasses a philosophy of ""improve but don't forget"" style of game development. Improve on what the original set down as the foundation but don't forget the roots that led to its creation - something that many sequels (and developers) seem to forget is so important. Not only for the development cycle, but for the success of the game itself. 

 
Dead Space 2 added a lot of new functions and mechanics, but at the core of its identity, the game was still recognizably Dead Space, and was all the better for it. One of the biggest improvements Dead Space 2 had over the original was the EVA walks. I always tout the EVA sections of this game as one of the best parts of the game and for good reason. The EVA portions of the first game were unique because there weren't many games at the time that allowed you to move around in a zero-g environment but they were very limited. Dead Space 2 took the elements that made the zero-g parts of Dead Space so much fun and added free-floating movement in full 360 degrees, and fixed the camera so that it no longer disoriented the player when landing upside down. I cannot stress how much of an improvement adding full movement capability to EVA did for the game. Visceral opened up all new possibilities for gameplay by doing so and it made Dead Space 2 a better game.
 

The improvements did not stop there. Combat opened up new possibilities as well. Visceral added a host of new weapons and tools to allow the player greater freedom in how they approached combat scenarios in the game. Although I prefer the trusty, tried and true plasma cutter, the weapons each have their own strengths and weaknesses, and all compliment each other. This goes back to what I mentioned before about ""improve but don't forget"". 
 

Dead Space 2 was and still is a marvel of game design and engineering. So rare is it to see a game that utilizes the full power of the system it is playing on but Dead Space 2 does, and it does it well. This is one of the few games I ever played that I still consider to be stunningly breathtaking and gorgeous to this day, and it's a testament to the love and care the design team in developing the game and its many environments. While I eagerly await the inevitable announcement (hopefully) of a remastered trilogy, I urge you all to go and play the game - take in the beautiful environments and stunning design and artworks. Dead Space 2 holds up better than I ever realized which becomes even more of a marvel when you find out it was built on the Tiger Woods PGA Tour engine. Yes, the game was developed using a golf simulation engine. The labyrinthine halls of the Sprawl, the towering and imposing walls of the Unitology church, and the silent vacuum of space are all painstakingly created and built with a deft touch not often found in games. 
 

Terror Never Dies
 

What constitutes a good horror game? Being chased by an unkillable enemy? Screeching violin chords? Dark hallways, flickering lights and a dying flashlight? Jump scares? No, I don't think so. All of these are common elements in most horror games but what I find to be the most important aspect, and one that could very well make or break your game, is the atmosphere. Atmosphere is everything. It sets the tone of your game. It tells the player what to expect. From the opening few seconds of Dead Space 2 right to the ending the atmosphere is unrelenting dread. There is nothing that can be done to stop what is happening, and all you can do is try to stay alive long enough to escape. Dread and hopelessness permeate Dead Space 2 throughout your entire journey on the Sprawl. Walking through the residential district, seeing the corpses of families and children who never made it out, and and seeing the blood splattered all over the walls of the elementary school drive home the intent of the developers. They want to make you feel terror and doom, and it works. 
 

Music is a big part of driving home a successful atmosphere of terror and fear, and Dead Space 2 is no pushover. The music is haunting, and it succeeds in what it sets out to do. From the creeping strings of the cello and hair-raising shrieks of the violins and the heart stopping pounding of the drums, the music is one of the strongest elements of the game. Of course, this aspect pales in comparison to the lighting.
 

No aspect of a horror game is perhaps as important as the lighting, even in comparison to the atmosphere. Lighting aids in the mood and plays such an important part in the psychological intent of your game. 


Visceral treats lighting as if it is a character unto itself, and that's a design philosophy I agree with. In no other genre is lighting so important as in horror. Scares are not dependent only on scary monsters and shrieking violins - you have to see what's coming at you. With the improved engine Visceral was able to cast deeper shadows, blacker blacks and brighter whites in their environments. Let me tell you - some of the kills Isaac has to endure are made all the more horrifying because of the stunning lighting used.


The church of Unitology remains one of the creepiest and most visually stunning places in any game I ever played, and it's all because of the lighting. The Ishimura, as well, in Chapter 10, contains arguably some of the best lighting in all of video games. The dark, oppressive atmosphere is aided immensely by the black hallways, minimal lights and the audio - the groans and creaking of the derelict ship send shivers down my spine every time I play through it. It would never have been as effective without the phenomenal lighting Visceral used.
 

A Legacy of Terror
 

Dead Space 2 is hailed as one of the best games ever made, and one of the best horror games ever made as well. It is easy to see why. Visceral put so much love and care into the game, and as I said earlier in this piece, achieved a feat very few developers ever manage by surpassing the original in nearly every aspect. Dead Space left a mark on gaming, and Dead Space 2 left its own as well. So many developers have attempted to emulate the incredible success of the two games and almost always fall short. When you stand on the shoulders of giants, be careful that you don't fall off, as the saying goes. 
 

The eighties and nineties were an era of greatness for horror games. Classics such as Clock Tower, Silent Hill, Resident Evil and Alone in the Dark were released, and went on to become known as some of the greatest horror games in history. Their legacies permeate the gaming industry to this day and influenced survival horror in ways that forever changed how these games would be developed. 
 

I like to think that Dead Space left its own mark. It proved that a survival horror game doesn't need to severely limit or handicap the player to be truly terrifying. The idea of being alone in space, with nobody there to help you, surrounded by nearly unstoppable monsters that take over your body - that's terrifying, even with a gun to help you.
 

Dead Space 2 succeeds as a horror game because of... you guessed it - the philosophy of ""improve but don't forget"". Atmosphere, music, gameplay, lighting, and philosophy all came together in a perfect storm to create a game that stands the test of time ten years later. Dead Space 2 is proof that in a great horror game, no matter how many times you play it... terror never dies.",1,0,1633211445.0
Unkilled,[classics playthroughs] I just finished playing Evil Genius for the first time!,"[For the uninitiated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_Genius_%28video_game%29)

Finally I have done it. I, Shen Yu, and my loyal servant Lord Kane - the first of my followers - have fullfilled my destiny to become ruler of Earth.

We all know what drove me to make the grab for power, but this is no time to praise me for my virtue, as this should be a brief summary of my *ascent* to power, not an hommage to my *rightousness*. On the first island I found myself on after being ousted be the so-called 'just', I slowly built my lair - in retrospect with many design flaws, but ultimately successful. I had placed my barracks directly at the entrance, since it was a low-heat room which would not interest the forces of justice, but this also meant that I had no chance of setting up a trap corridor on the first island...

In any case, I slowly stole the first loot items and tier 2 specialists, giving me the first advanced minions. I took my sweet time advancing my notoriety and paused once to steal about 2 million dollars, and only then expanded my lair and continued the Acts of Infamy I needed to advance the main missions.

Before leaving for island 2, I had all available minion types, all physical loot available and around 3 mio cash. I also did all research (a few traps excluded). My second henchman was the matron, since she seemed the best support to Kane.

On island 2 I made sure to have 2 long trap corridors leading agents away from the entrance to my main base, but ultimately they failed to really work - 80% of the time, agents would force the door to the trap corridors, then turn away before entering. Whenever wind or magnet traps pulled them in successfully, my own minions would inevitabely suffer with them. In the end, going to yellow alert (so my minions would arm themselves) and using henchmen was far more effective.

Anyway, my first room into the lair was a loot-item-free barracks leading into the main armory. Before this came 2 blind empty corridors, and quite a few heavy security doors to gain time when needed. The armory contained multiple weapon racks, the cells and many loot items since it was the designated main 'hang-around-area'. to the north was a mess hall, a borderless staff room and behind that the stronghold. This ensured the stronghold (where minions had to travel to and from when purchasing gear or building rooms, as well as store money stolen) was relatively accessible, but also deep enough so enemies would have to pass the armory, which could not *possibly* happen undetected.

Behind the Armory was the freezer, again for accessibility reasons. To the southwest I built the infirmary loop (being an L-bend to both the armory and the archives), and southeast I placed the archives. To the right from the archives was a seperate control room (without alarms, so acts of infamy could continue uninterrupted by local alarms), and to the south I built a huge training room (containing every equipment at least twice to speed up training), followed in the lower right by the laboratory. Further to the right were merely the Inner Sanctum for my Evil Genius, and the Power Plant. All entrances, and indeed sections up until the armory where guarded by cameras. Alarms would be raised in every room besides the control room, the laboratory and the training room, and the tiny barracks enclave that contained the sole security desk - all this ensured all available personnel would be alarmed, but not interrupting any vital function of my operation.

Arriving at the island, this somewhat tedious layout meant my minions had to travel extremely long distances, and this already at the start of the excavation process. The creation of the power plant alone took ages. However, when it was finished there would be no serious threat whatsoever. Only once one enemy made it past the armory, and this only because I was elsewhere at the time and just paid him no mind. When he stole a loot item, he was automatically killtagged and taken care of before I managed to turn my attention to him. This was also before the placement of 4 heavy security doors, which stumped all but the most persistent enemy agents after him. Most threats were stopped before even reaching the barracks, and even those that reached them had seen nothing to incriminate me and my operation. I alternated between gently showing them outside and killing them for entertainment.

I followed the mission path while every now and then taking the time to target more optional goals, which meant getting rid of the enemy super agents permanently. One by one they fell, while of course one could only be removed when another was already a conrete threat... No matter, I managed to kill them off as soon as possible, and not only never faced more than 2 at a time, due to careful notoriety management I also avoided the most dangerous super agent (John Steele) completely! I stayed under 340 notoriety when I finished my masterpiece, the value at which John Steele would have taken notice of me - the proud fool, now he is far too late...

Everything but super agents posed no real problem at all, occasionally a few social or science minions would be mowed down, but this was easily fixed with a few minutes of training. Everytime I permanently disposed of a super agent I basically played pressure free, as Kane could stop anyone in his tracks while everybody else could get in free shots at the immobilized target, so that the current 'unkillable' super agent was dealt with. In the end I had Kane, the matron, Jubei and Mesmero. Kane would hypnotise the enemy, while Jubei would teleport to him and immonilize him. Never did this strategy fail me.

I hit a road block when I needed more low-tier workers for the rocket test firing as only they could enter the test chamber as needed, but I cold-heartedly killtagged a number of specialists, then simply retrained them when I had succeeded. Soon, I gave my TV speech to the leaders of the world, and when they laughed at me I swore bitter vengeance and ordered the assembly of my rocket.

During the mere 12 minutes this process took me at the height of my power, I had to face off waves and waves of enemy soldiers (which would attack anyone on sight; different from the former mere investigators and thieves), but with my prodigious foresight I had replaced diplomats in all regions with my puppets to seed discord among them, and so I watched gleefully as they all turned on each other. My henchmen, locked into a hastily constructed topside shack only to be let out when enemy soldiers came too close, as well as a number of sentry guns which originally protected the sending array for my TV ultimatum, took care the stragglers.

And when the time ended I pressed the button, sending my rocket up into space where it deployed its playload - an advanced satellite that bombarded earth with my own creation called ID Blank, clearing the mind of every human on earth and turning them into my loyal minions. Resistance *was* futile - just like I told everybody at the start.

This I, Shen Yu, leave for those after me.

Unkilled,"My first time past White Haven, and a thank you to Cubsey","Today was the first time I didn't head for either Romero or Yawpton right out of the spawn. Instead I headed for the island chain off the coast and just managed to avoid getting killed by some iron clad bandits raiding Romero. In the deserted island chain I collected a suit of leather armor as well as a stone sword and a few health potions, both of which have been rare in my limited traveling. 
After that I headed up to Bazel, a place I'd only been once before, and raided all the houses, as well as tricking and killing a player to my shame. With my new found and half stolen chain armor I felt unkillable and decided to keep going North.
After finding a a pile of food and weapons in the desert from a player who hadn't been as lucky as myself, I managed to make it all the way up to the gravel plains and by a fluke, Al Hasa, where I was almost murdered by more iron clad bandits but survived by hiding at the top of the tower as they mauled another innocent traveler and moved on.
From there I dropped into the basin, gathering food at the Abandoned Farm, Leaping over a pit of magma and then lowering myself down a cliff face at Camp Azara, and eventually finding a ship moored on dry land. The two players searching the ship asked me ""friend or foe"" and not wanting to end my trip so soon I yelled back friend. So, the shot at me. I'm sure it would have been my end had a pack of Zed not caught them as the gave chase.
After I ran up the giant staircase, fleeing both the bandits and the Zed devouring them, I took refuge in the tower of KnoxMoor, hoping to find food and water to refill my canteens. Unfortunately, the Zed had been waiting there too, and I was forced to use all my remaining arrows holding them at the bottom of the stairs for the night. And all that for an axe and an ender pearl, both of which had to be used to escape Knoxmoor.
Starving and nearly out of food, with just two apples and a scrap of Zed flesh left, I headed West to the river, and followed that North in hopes of finding food. unfortunately, all I found was a clearing with what appeared to be two giant heads, one of plant and ice, the other of obsidian and fire, having a staring contest, neither of them were very helpful and all I managed to scrounge was a half broken iron sword which I used to repair my own. 
Still with a shortage of food, I continued heading West until I came upon Crowmure, my new favorite town. There I managed to heap together about a half suit of iron armor, an amazing feet for someone who rarely even gets full leather. But when I was searching the tower, I heard someone, and having not seen another person who wasn't prowling for a victim in almost four hours, I was cautions for the first fifteen minutes of us being in the same town, but after crawling to the very top of the tower, five stories above them, and taking aim with my new and heavily enchanted bow, I felt confident enough to open communication. The other player was named something like ""Cubsey"" and we both agreed that having spent so much time on both of our separate voyages to Crowmure it would be a waste to end either of our lives in PvP.
""Cubsey"" moved on to White Haven to get some food and I went back to searching Crowmure for supplies and generally annoying the Zed, but when I was leaving the last building I was attacked by a zombie in the door way, not much of a threat now that I wasn't a noob in leather with a wooden sword, except after we fought my vision went wobbley.
I thought my trip was finished for sure and I got on the radio to announce my doom and invite any near by players to pick through what I was leaving behind, but when I announced that I was infected, ""Cubsey"" got on and offered to bring me medication.
This is the kindest act that I have ever experienced in all my time as a gamer. ""Cubsey"" made the trip back from White Haven to Crowmure to save a player who had barely spoken to them and had considered killing them just as a precaution. After that I emptied my inventory of everything I thought might help express my extreme gratitude. We said we would keep in touch over the radio, and parted ways again.
Still not possessing a full set of iron armor, I decided I would head to Castle Byesford, which was a horrid mistake since my time as an infected had forced me down to only one health potion. After swimming half way around the island I managed to make it past the wall and up to the gate, another mistake. Through the gate I could see a horde of zombies covering every exit, entrance, and lobby, and being an idiot I decided I could take them all out with the one ender pearl I had left. This mostly just pissed them off and I ended up wasting half my arrows, my last health potion, and getting myself down to one heart. Then, ""Cubsey"" called me up on the radio to ask if I was still alive, I said yes but relayed my predicament, and to their credit, ""Cubsey"" offered to make another trip from White Haven, this time all the way to Castle Byesford, to help me out. During this conversation another player, named ""New Project"" or something started creeping through the woods toward the gate, and when they saw my name they asked, again, ""Friend of foe"" and, again, I replied friend, because I really needed one about that time.
I thought of what I had done to the player in Bazel after convincing him I was an ally, and what the bandits holed up in the pirate ship had tried to do to me after I announced I was a friend, but then I thought of what ""Cubsey"" had done for me for no reason what so ever and thought that maybe other players weren't the scum of the earth after all, at least after you get past Yawpton.
""Cubsey"" was on their way, but I didn't know if they would get to the castle in time, and so I told ""New Project"" of the peril I was in and asked for help and to my surprise they offered to help. I started to make my way to them, sneaking around the wandering Zed, and when I was finally in a clear line of sight, ""New Project"" shot me in the face.

My most successful trip ever, through betrayals, narrow escapes, benevolent strangers, perilous leaps over pits of death, barely avoiding starvation on a few occasions, discovering strange and wonderful places, and nearly six hours of game play was all ended by a lying twat with a bow.
TL;DR Got saved by someone named ""Cubsey"" and got killed by someone named ""New Project""",1,0,1346550573.0

Call me a Gangsta,GTA San Andreas: The worst gaming experience I can remember.,"TL:DR - I'm here to bitch and moan about San Andreas. If you don't want to hear my ramblings, don't waste your time, just move along.

Seriously, fuck everything about San Andreas, the worst gaming experience I can remember.

I am no stranger when it comes to gaming. I got my first NES in the late 80's. Went through Super Nintendo, PlayStation, XBOX, PS2 and now own a PS3. I've been playing games on PC since ""hunt the Wumpus"" in the mid 80's. In short, I have used a keyboard, I feel comfortable with a controller and i know how to mow down trash talking teenagers. Am I Gamer? I don't know. Ive been playing for 25 years (I'm 30 now), but I would call myself a ""casual gamer"". I never pre-order games. I don't care about achievements. Couldn't care less about leader boards. I don't keep up with the latest and greatest gaming news. I care about being entertained, that's all.

But Fuck everything about San Andreas.

I remember hanging out in my friend's living room during Christmas break of 2001. We were freshmen in college and he had this game ""I just had to try"". It was called Grand Theft Auto III. ""You can kill hookers"" he said with a grin as we popped the game in the PS2 and began our rampage. On my way home, I stopped by Best Buy and bought that shit.

My roommates in college loved it. We spent hours playing. I had never been so engrossed in a game. When Vice City came out, I bought it right up.

I heard San Andreas was coming out and it was even BIGGER than GTA III and Vice city. I had to have it. then my friends told me not to bother, it sucks. I know not every sequel can be a hit, so i skipped it. I didn't really care that much, besides I had Vice City and III to keep me company.

My brother ended up buying the game and I watched him play a little bit. ""You have to go to the gym?...Fuck that"" is what i recall saying at the time.

When I bought my PS3, the only other thing i bought with it was GTA IV (OK, I also got Metal Gear). My god was I blown away. The story. The missions. The next gen graphics. Ive played the game several times, keeping track of the choices I made to see if the game play is any different next time. It is still my favorite of all the GTA's.

But, seriously, fuck San Andreas.

GTA V is about to be released. I am excited. Then came Steam's winter sale. All GTA games for like 20 bucks or something retarded like that. ""Hell ya!"" I said. I never played Ballad of Gay Tony or Lost and the Damned. But there was another game as well. The now-dead-to-me San Andreas.

I had to play that first...right after i finish assassin's creed on PS3.

So a few weeks ago, i had steam open to see what's what and San Andreas was staring at me. ""Sure"" I said...""Why not"".

Ive never played GTA on PC before, so it took me a few minutes to get the hang of the controls. I got them down and started my spiral of disappointment.

Gangs? really? What kind of ghetto-ass bullshit is this? I want to be a GANGSTER not a GANGSTA

Now I have to play a stupid ass low rider mini game? What the fuck?

But the first time i thought of quitting the whole thing was when, for the hundredth time, I heard ""All you had to do was follow the train CJ!""

Fuck you smoke or sweet or whatever (never bothered to learn every one's name). Jesus, I did everything the tutorials said. 

Stay to the right - Check

Stay Up front - Check

Misc Bullshit - Check

Finally, after 2 days of trying (I play after I get home from work, before my wife gets home), I did it. I can continue with this shit-pile.

So I continue. And now, I get to the mission with the remote control planes. The one where the controls were designed by the guy who made QWOP with help from the dude that invented uncontrollable anal leakage.

After about 20 attempts (one of which, i killed everyone only to run out of gas before i hit the mark), I read more tutorials. They all said something similar: Don't bother trying to fly the plane, drive it around, IN REVERSE!, so you don't waste gas.


Seriously, what the fuck? They only way to consistently beat the mission is to play it in a way unintended? What kind of bullshit is that?

At least the next mission with the helicopter, though only slightly less frustrating, is played by actually flying the goddamned thing.

Whatever, Ill just beat this real fast and get to Wu Zi's mission.

Oh wait, that's right, i cant play that one until i spend an hour swimming underwater to get my ""lung capacity"" to where it needs to be.

FUCK!

OK, I have too much time invested in this game now to quit, so ill do the swimming.

Wow, a few missions in a row where I don't want to just quit this damn thing.

OH YEAH! My brother is getting out of prison! What awesome shit are we gonna get ourselves into?

Oh....more gang banging...gee.......greaaaaat

Take over this neighborhood...take over that neighborhood...You must take over more neighborhoods to get this mission.

Finally, this morning, I look up how much I have to control. ""35% unlocks the final mission"" they all say. I'm at 32. Fine, Ill finish the 35% and get to the last mission and finally never play this fucker again.

33%

34.7%

Finally 35%. I get the phone call to meet my brother to take down smoke or sweet, whichever is the bad one.

I save the game, quit and go take a shower.

I come back to see ""Save game corrupted, cannot load file""

FUUUUUUUUUCCCKKKKK!!!!!!!

So i look up how to restore it.

""There are tools"" they say. 'This worked for me"" they say.

Well, even the recovery tools don't recognize the file.

""Well, here's a spot with all of the save games...download the one for the last mission and just play it""

Great..but every save game i download takes me to the beginning ""Liberty city 1992 airport"" when i load it. Finally, I gave up about an hour ago. Fuck it.

Fuck everything about this game.

I just finished watching the last mission on YouTube just to see how this damn thing ended.

Now I'm off to play Gay Tony or Lost/Damned, whichever i happen to load first. All I want to do is forget this whole experience with one of my favorite franchises. I hope GTA V is good.",0,6,1360707879.0
Call me a Gangsta,"After months of scientific experiments on assorted retards, I have concluded that Call of Duty is a game made by abunch of Jabronis for abunch of other Jabronis.","- FPS games require little to virtually NO problem solving skills and a quick gander into any open Call of Duty game reveals that everyone is usually content to run around like a complete moron and not bother trying to attack problems with any real semblance of tactics. Infact the very notion of a kill/death ratio system eliminates any possibility of that idea since it makes the game about how many times you can mindlessly kill eachother over how many times you die. Upon sighting your enemy your brain has become conditioned to shooting automatically making its core ideas basically about who has the fastest reflex action. If you extrapolate that even further the game is basically an elaborate system based on that tactic alone that resembles how rats are tested in a lab on their behaviour in accordance to when and how they are rewarded for food. In short, the only people routinely entertained by Call of Duty are the same idiots who enjoy Vin Diesel smash em ups, colouring and shiny objects or keys being jingled in their faces.

- The people who own and release Call of Duty every year are essentially snake oil salesmen who tack abunch of useless shit onto the same game once every november then use their grandiose marketing department to bombard everyone for 6 months. In short, its a glorified racket and they're not interested in hearing the same complaints about the game's fundamentals every time a new one comes out. Just keep churning out the same re-hashed shit, boys! Nobody will notice! There's even an infamous fake radio commercial about it in the newest Grand Theft Auto! Why not just have the next Call of Duty feature a vacuum hose directly hooked up to your wallet and they can run their racket that way?

- How is a ""competitive"" system of gaming remotely ""competitive"" down to split seconds when you're talking 2 people shooting at each other on the internet, who are really miles and miles apart? If kills and other deaths come down to single bullet count, how is that sort of thing differentiated at the highest competitive level? I got a better idea, why not just make the next call of duty a simple game of russian roulette? there's no skill involved, at its basic level you're all slaves to whoever has the best connection and THATS why you get so frustrated dumping an entire magazine of bullets into some fuckstick's face, only to have him somehow kill you first, because on his screen, he was already shooting at you before you even had a chance to rise your gun on your screen.

- Competitiveness in a video game anyway? I thought we were doing this to have fun? You want some REAL competition, get your fat, pasty bloated ass outside and challenge someone to a foot race, lol At least they're here in person and you're not relying on the aforementioned points from above where I bitched about the internet connection in relevance to gaming success arms race.

- The games are ALL THE SAME every year! I mentioned this already, but I'd just thought I'd reiterate that point again, as you get fleeced another 60 bucks for the same 6 months of slow, glacial frustration you'll encounter by the same game with the same fundamental problems. The Jews running the show at Activision are laughing all the way to the bank for their yacht funds, Especially with this newest game, where they hassled everyone for the past 6 months on how everything was ""redesigned."" What were the improvements and redesigns again? Because to me its the same old call of duty and the same old list of problems EVERYONE bitches about whenever they release a ""new"" one.

- The few smug assholes who happen to say they DO work together in matches...  Yeah right, you guys are saving the whole thing for everyone else, one game at a time, right?

- Taken a look at the player designed emblems ever in black ops 2? Well, once they finally cracked down on the chicken-scratch crude bathroom porn all the virgin 14 year olds took the time out to carefully and meticulously design, the remains are STILL the same egomaniacal chest thumping crap, further designed by MORE teenaged morons or two-bit low IQ fully grown adults. (Who no doubt love Vin Diesel movies, colouring, shiny objects and keys being jingled in their faces... Right?) Well, that should give you a tiny window into each person's mind. They say ""art"" is a window into someone's soul, and judging by all those identical player emblems, all of these idiots are exactly the same, act the same and even play the same stupid maps the same.


This is all scientifically backed and was the results of hundreds of tests done on tanned guidos, brainless stoners, racist 12 year olds and mostly anyone else who says things like ""swag"" or talks like an idiot into their mics, (Which is a WHOLE OTHER can of worms.) Anyway, leave your detritus in the comments section where you justify your own explanations on how I am wrong, I won't care because I'll be too busy fucking your mothers while you hide behind a door in the newest Racket of Duty.

Call me a Legend,"I averaged 14 ""Best Games of All Time"" lists from the last five years together, and these are the results","# Explanation and methodology

I compiled fourteen different ""best of all time"" lists to create one definitive list. It was originally going to be a top 100 but I ended up having enough data to make a consensus top 200. For each list I gave each game a score based on placement (i.e. one point for 100th place, two points for 99th place, all the way up to 100 points for 1st place). I also gave a certain amount of extra points for simply being on the list--otherwise games that ranked low would get basically no advantage over games that didn't rank at all. The amount differed based on whether the list was a top 50, top 100, top 200, and so on. Making it onto more exclusive lists obviously granted more points. 

# Lists used

I averaged together the following lists, with diverse perspectives and recent publication being a priority in which lists I chose: 

**Media rankings**: Empire (UK, 2023), USA Today (US, 2022), Popular Mechanics (US, 2022), Looper (US, 2022) IGN (international, 2021), Slant magazine (USA, 2020) Game Informer (US, 2018) Games TM (UK, 2018)

**Critic ratings**: Metacritic top 200 Metascores of all time (as of 2023)

**Gamer ratings**: IMDB top 200 user ratings of all time (as of 2023), Ranker top 200 user ratings of all time (as of 2023)

**Critic polls**: British GQ Industry Poll (UK, 2023)

**Gamer polls:** TV Asahi viewer poll (Japan, 2021), Hobby Consolas reader poll (Spain/Latin America, 2021)

Call me a Legend,I aggregated more than 700 greatest games lists. Here are the results.,"# The Data

The source data includes any list from a reliable source and chosen primarily by the publication's editorial staff (lists based on reader polls were excluded). More than 100 publications from \~15 different countries are represented. A few lists have platform restrictions but the vast majority are unrestricted. The method is able to handle ranked lists, unranked lists, partially ranked lists, and lists with a one-per-series restriction, so all of these have been included. In total there are 98 all time lists, 51 end of decade lists, \~570 end of year lists (this includes GOTY awards), and 9 miscellaneous lists. A full list of all of the included source data can be found here: [https://www.acclaimedvideogames.com/lists/](https://www.acclaimedvideogames.com/lists/)

# The Method

Lists are weighted according to their age (newer lists are very slightly favoured), and a reputation score assigned to each publication (all of the big gaming publications have the maximum reputation score). Another weighting is then applied that essentially penalises publications for repeating themselves across multiple lists. This prevents the most prolific publications from dominating the final rankings. Then, a program tracks how often each game appears ahead of every other game on lists that they were both eligible for. The matchups on the resulting table are then rigorously cross referenced to determine which games performed the best overall. In short, the games at the top are the ones that consistently beat other highly ranked games, while rarely losing to lower ranked games.

# The Results

The full list goes all the way to 1000 and can be found here: [https://www.acclaimedvideogames.com/games/alltime/](https://www.acclaimedvideogames.com/games/alltime/) Copying the entire list would take up far too much space, but here's the top 100:

# Background info and where to from here?

This is a project that I've been working on since early 2020. I started it because the current go to sources for gauging the critical consensus on video games, specifically Metacritic and OpenCritic, are both based on review scores. I felt like there was room for a website with a rigorous methodology that ranks games based on lists as well (for some reason there's a slight difference between games that do well in reviews and games that do well on lists). It's still early days (the website only launched last year), but I'd really like for the rankings to be taken somewhat seriously one day. Here's hoping.

The next big project will be adding more platform lists. This won't change much at the top of the list, but it should provide better resolution further down. It may also allow me to increase the list to 1500 games, which would be a nice bonus. It won't happen quickly as it requires a ton of data entry, as well as possibly writing a more careful eligibility checker (the current one is pretty good, but it doesn't always make good guesses when release dates are unknown), but hopefully I'll have at least some of it done by the end of the year. Besides that, I'll be updating to include any important lists that come in. Certain website features also need a bit of attention.

The website is not monetised in any way. There are no ads, affiliate links, subscription options, or donation pages. It will remain that way for the foreseeable future.

  
Edit: The website page numbers are not working on some browsers! This will be fixed soon, sorry!",8355,1432,1720958728.0

Call me a Legend,"What’s a game that you cherish that you no longer play, but it’ll always be special to you?","What’s a game that you cherish but you no longer play because it’s gone down hill? 

Town of Salem is a game I’ve loved for around around 10 years or so. It was traditionally a browser game you’d play for free, but once they moved it over to Steam, I loved the game so much I wanted to support the devs and paid for it. I have 647 hours on it on steam so God knows how many I have altogether. I used to call myself a “veteran player.” I made sure I could play all the roles so I’d never let my team down. 

Part of the reason I loved that game is because I like the game “Werewolf.” I like to sniff out liars, and if I’m evil I like to lie and snake my way to the win. It’s just fun and it’s a skill that you learn the more you play. 

But… I haven’t played in a long time now. Every time I re-install it and open it up, I uninstall again cause it just doesn’t feel the same anymore. There’s not much that’s new to the game. But mostly it has to do with the community being soooooo awful and the devs don’t do ANYTHING about it. Too many spammers, bots, leavers, trolls and game-throwers…toxicity. nothing is done about it and it ruins the experience. 

And it takes a while to get a game going cause the community is losing genuine good players. Plus, when I did play, it stressed me out and gave me chest pains cause people often didn’t listening to facts and use logic… in a game that requires logic lol. Didn’t like the chest pains anymore. And this is coming from a 12 year long League of Legends player lol. 

I think I’m permanently done with Town of Salem and it makes me sad that I no longer feel the urge to play it anymore. But I still have a soft spot for that game. Maybe if I hear news about the game and community improving I’ll go back, but until then…

I’ve since moved on to Among Us lol. Been playing that for a year and even though it has its differences, I really very much enjoy it. :) ",475,821,1722655471.0
Call me a Legend,"Harassing Female Gamers, why?","I want to state first that this is not an isolated event; I have been gaming hardcore since I was ten years old, and Diablo was first released, and ever since I picked up a microphone, I've been verbally assaulted for simply being a female voice among the men. I've played on most of the consoles out there (Nintendo, Super Nintendo, SEGA, Dreamcast, the PS series, the Xbox series, N64) and of course, PC.  I play games that require, for team reasons, a microphone (CS:GO, Rust, League of Legends, Dayz, Dead by Daylight(etc), as well as many MMO's over the years were guild/clan ventrilos/mumbles/etc were required.)

Mainly it is games like CS:GO where I am running into grown men who are constantly harassing me in game, and if I fail to respond after they discover I am of the opposite sex, they will then throw grenades at me, say sexually explicit things,  and go so far as to threaten to do me bodily harm outside of the game.  I don't understand, why do guys do this? If you are someone who has done this, what is the reasoning? Sure, I can just block your communication, but why should I have to block somewhere every game, or every other game?

Heaven FORBID if someone tries to defend me, because then we're both flamed. I just played a game of CS:GO where a stranger stepped up to defend me, asking this GROWN MAN why he thought it was necessary to speak to me this way. The guy was accused of White Knighting, was shot at, team killed, etc, for simply trying to defend me, because I was doing the best thing I had in defense; silence. I was told I must give this guy great pussy, that my nudes must be smoking for him to care enough to say something.

I didn't know this guy.  I didn't respond, I didn't make calls.  I spend the entire game trying to ignore the situation, and then politely thanked the person via a message for his attitude.  I didn't need a White Knight - and I rarely get one - but it's nice to know not everyone thinks it's okay to be an asshole simply because I happen to be a female voice at the other end of a computer.

I really just don't understand.  I wasn't bringing the team down, I'm not a bad player. I just wanted to make a call so you knew there were people rushing A long. I just wanted to be a team player, and all I got in return was a grown man asking about my pussy and the smell and my sex life and... I'm sorry, but that's none of your business. I just want to play the game - I don't want your attention, good or bad.

**EDIT**: I am honestly shocked at the level of response I have received for this post. I never expected for this to blow up to what it has become, and am undeniably pleased by the fact that there are so many people that believe this is an incorrect way to act toward someone, no matter their gender, age, sexual orientation, race, or religion. Anonymity should not generate the feeling that being disgusting toward another person is acceptable, whether it be an online community or gaming community.

For those of you who said this had opened there eyes, and that next time they saw someone being attacked online, they would step in, you are awesome and are appreciated. Like many of you have pointed out, step up not just for the female gamer, but for the kid with the high pitched voice, or the man getting called out for having a 'black' sounding voice, or for any other person that is being harassed online in a manner that is not appropriate. 

I know shit talking in game exists, will always exist, but there is a line between playing a competitive game and being in the heated moment, and from verbally assaulting someone relentlessly for no other reason except for them being the easy victim in front of you at the time.**",1674,1629,1473332434.0
Call me a Legend,I want to turn away from online games,"Hello fellow gamers,

I am playing Online Games for like 15 years now.
It started with the Call of Duty Series on Ps3, went over to League of Legends until 2014, Wow until last year and then i picked up Guild Wars 2.

I just can‘t play them like a normal person. 
When I don‘t play them, wonderful things happen in my life. I stick waaay more to fitness and gym, care more about my job and my gf and I am a better friend.
When I try to stay away, I play games like Witcher, Skyrim.. but I get bored out

I tried completely without them, but I always come back somehow.

All I want is a couple of offline games that entertain me enough to not put them down, but don‘t make me that addictive

Call me a Legend,[Fan Made] Star Wars Fighting Game,"Mortal Kombat 1 inspired me to scrap up a concept of a Star Wars Lightsaber dueling game. Some features would be:

1) You could call “Kameo” assist fighters like in MK1 who have blasters, tech, airstrike etc. to get an all encompassing Star Wars Fighting game that doesn’t feel/look imbalanced.

2) Each mainline fighter has different lightsaber forms that are selectable after choosing a character to call back to the various forms these Jedi/Sith have fought with. Think of the different versions of fighters in MKX.

3) Skins for both Mainline Fighters and Assist Fighters that encompass all of Legends and the Saga.

4) No “Fatalities” but perhaps stylish brutalities that are tame enough for Disney (Hands cut off, maybe a limb or two)

5) I am aware that there is a fan made Star Wars fighting game by a youtuber Last Jawa and it’s great, highly recommend!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Original Post**

WarZ Devs have reportedly just released a patch which proves their quick money-grabbing and game-breaking schemes. After changing the description of their game due to TotalHailbut calling them out on false advertising, they have now updated the game with a new patch.

Steam users are reporting the following: ""... They actually increased the respawn-timer from 1 hour to 4 hours. BUT they added a revive button, where you can spend 50GC (real money) to revive them instantly.""
Additionally, they are now forcing you to sign the TOS to play the game, which includes disallowing refunds. This is against the law.

How is it against the law? False advertising, which is still going on. [CLICKY](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/cases/redress.shtml)

News is unraveling extremely fast about WarZ and its current stature. Here is all of the latest.

**2.** User [Thunderbridge](http://www.reddit.com/user/Thunderbridge) makes a great comment below on how they are working their money system.
""Umm how about refund posts are not allowed on these forums. You must submit a support ticket at support.thewarz.com and have your case reviewed. They don't want you going through Steam support to get a refund, they want you to go to their site where, after accepting their new TOS, you are no longer entitled to a refund, while they laugh all the way to the bank. That's called fraud by the way"". Well said.

**4.** User [maleficmatt](http://www.reddit.com/user/maleficmatt) tells others how to avoid the TOS - if you have had the displeasure of buying the game.
""Just an FYI for people, if you hit decline on the TOS after the game patches the client will close. You can then simply reboot the client and the TOS will not show up. I have not yet hit ""accept"" on the TOS since the game launched. Not sure if this works with the steam version"". Nice find!

Call me a Legend,"Counter argument for Nintendo's E3 Wii announcements, ""All of those games are *just* sequels or remakes.""","Trolls and fanboys of Nintendo's competition no doubt live by the golden rule ""Haters Gonna Hate"" and there's nothing anyone can say to change that.  Nintendo has generally received positive views/reactions at this year's E3 and the main criticism I've seen all over the internets is that ""All of their games are sequels or remakes.""  So I did some homework to put this opinion (fact?) in perspective.

I made a list of games announced from the Big 3's keynotes - excluding the casual/motion control games (Wii Party, Mario Sports Mix, Kinect games and Move games etc) and ALL LISTS, COMPARISONS AND INFO ONLY PERTAINS TO HOME CONSOLE RELEASES.  I'm not taking into account spin-off titles either.  For example. *Kirby's Epic Yarn* is the 21st fucking Kirby game to be released, but only the 4th platforming/adventure game to be released on a home console.  I didn't omit spin-offs or handheld versions to skew any numbers; I am simply trying to compare apples to apples.  The *Donkey Konga* games star DK, but its not the same genre or gameplay etc so *Donkey Konga* is irrelevant to *Donkey Kong Country*. 

**First, the short lists:**

**Microsoft**
Other than Kinect games they showed Halo: Reach, Call of Duty: Black Ops and Gears of War 3.

**Nintendo**
Zelda: Skyward Sword, Donkey Kong Country Returns, Kirby's Epic Yarn, Metroid: Other M, Disney Epic Mickey, NBA Jam and Goldeneye 007.

**Sony**
Other than Move titles they showed Killzone 3, Little Big Planet 2, Dead Space 2, Gran Turismo 5, Twisted Metal.

	⁃	Epic Mickey (Wii) 2010

NBA Jam is a remake/reboot of the 1993 game.

Goldeneye 007 is a remake/rebbot of the 1997 game.

**Conclusion**
Every game shown by the Big 3 are sequels.  NBA Jam and Goldeneye are the only ""remakes.""  Zelda and Metroid are the only titles that have previously been on Wii, all the others are new to the platform.  All three of Microsoft's showcased games are sequels to games that have been on the 360 already.  Sony introduced old IPs (Twisted Metal & GT) but are debuts on the platform but every game is still a sequel.  Wii is flooded with 2D/3D platformers, Xbox is flooded with FPS and in terms of genres alone Sony's is the most diverse.

It doesn't bother me if you don't like Nintendo as a company, or you hate their IPs and hate side scrollers etc.  Your allegiance to a console/game manufacturer is your prerogative .  I just don't like generic troll-bait comments like ""they only release sequels and remakes"" when in fact that's all that was announced for all systems.  Now that I've shot my Nintendo wad I'm gonna go find games on other systems to drool (and fap) over.  For science.

Call me a Legend,Any good couch coop games you would reccomend (ps5)?,"my gf is visiting me in a few days and we play games a lot so im looking for some more to play. we beat borderlands, minecraft, unravel two, rayman legends, sackboy, a way out, it takes two, some call of duty, a few dark pictures anthologies, the binding of isac so basically anything is a go as long as its split screen/ couch coop. thanks

Call me a Legend,Steam Summer Sale Pay It Forward,"KNOWN SCAMMERS / BEGGARS:

* Slim Shady:  http://steamcommunity.com/id/codybjames (http://imgur.com/a/ZBpLN#0 as proof) (Has gifted after that, however)

How to Get your Gift History:  http://imgur.com/a/PLfFS#0

So here's the deal. The Steam Summer Sale is always full of goodies, and often we have a lot of the games. However, not all of our friends do, and the world always needs more giving and less taking. I will take the first person on the list and add them to my friends list, and buy them a game.  I ask that that person take the next name on the list and pay it forward. Hopefully we can get a ton of games sold and given away to people, and make more Steam friends in the process. Challenge accepted? 

BTW: I'm vastly amused by the downvotes. ""Let's be generous!"" ""BOOOOOOOOO!"" Sorry, gave me a giggle here. ;)

BTW, my Steam ID is 'Shinino'. I'd love to have friends. Not worried about receiving stuff (although I don't turn it down). This is more about giving, not getting ,and I have a ton of games. :)

Note:  I'm trying to add everyone here to my friends list.  It doesn't mean I'm immediately gifting whatever particular game you're asking for.  If I do gift you, it doesn't mean I'm gifting any particular game (unless it's the only thing on your wish list).   Asking me specifically to gift you something, or complaining about why I'm adding you to my friends list (which you accepted, btw) then not gifting you?  That's a quick way for me to remove you from my Friends list, and a way to ensure that I'm not about to gift you.  I'm not going to call people out in this thread (yet), but I just wanted to get the point across.  The spirit here is that I gifted something to someone, then they gift to someone else, and so on.  Be happy when you get gifted, and gift someone else.  Be generous, not an ass.  Okay?  Okay.  

Carry on!

Call me a Legend,I got F'd in the A by Activision! ,"**Basically I won an elite prize that they are refusing to give me, I wanna get all the shit ive gone through out there in hope that not only will my problem get solved, but activision will sort out their customer service for everyone in the same boat! TLDR**



So, sadly I fell into the trap of an Elite subscription for MW3, paying for ""premium services"" and so on when really I get the same shitty customer service as always. Anyway on the 23rd of January I signed up for one of the elite events (https://elite.callofduty.com/compete/operations/view/572) a capture the flag event; whoever caught the most flags in 3 hours wins a Oakley Kitchen Sink Backpack (RRP: £160/$200 roughly).

So the event finished! palms, brow, sack all slightly sweaty after an epic 3 hours of hardcore scrubbyness and I refresh the page to see I won, WHOOOP! In my sweaty Fanboy state the day after I create a ticket because i haven't had a response, heres what I got:

http://i.imgur.com/EIZLe.png

So I read through the T&C's again to find out what happens next and it turns out i should have waited:

**"" In general, it can take up to 7 days to verify all winners. If you have won, please be patient while the Pathfinders verify all potential winners."" (MW3 forums, Beachhead)** 

Now we all know how bad activision are at keeping to schedule so I sit back and wait. So 10 days later i'm still waiting for my email, I decide its time to take action! I grabbed my phone and called the support line (based in the USA so it costs me a fortune as i'm from the UK!) Anyway after 10 minutes of terrible hold music I get through to a rep. I explain that I have had no email and would like to give them my details so they can ship my awesome prize that I deserve. Anyway he rambles on for 5 minutes explaining it's not down to him and I need to email callofdutyeliterewardsupport@activision.com and request my prize, so I did, on a number of occassions...

http://i.imgur.com/dteDY.png

As you can see i sent a total of 7 emails (Suman.basra replied every time with a generic answer which I deleted; Sorry!!!!) Anyway this went on for weeks!

I phoned customer support like clockwork and eventually nearly 2 months on I got through to a chap called Dustin, guys a legend and really helpful! Here's the ticket they started for me (read each picture bottom to top) 

http://i.imgur.com/rMtEs.png
http://i.imgur.com/I9JlU.png
http://i.imgur.com/P3naq.png
http://i.imgur.com/TNVWa.png

So finally after 2 months of waiting i get my confirmation email, I fill it out like its made of gold and post! i'm overjoyed finally I get my bag!!!!1!11!1! 

....or not.... 

I woke up this morning after sending my details on the 18th of march to find this email in my inbox: 

http://i.imgur.com/n8Cj6.png 

Heres my reply on my original thread 

http://i.imgur.com/L2pfb.png

I read and slowly fill with rage, the moment I finished posting to my thread I had my phone in hand calling activision support once more! time for a can of woop-ass! 

**will post updates as and when I get them!**


So, the reason for this thread. 

1) To shed light on just how shit a service Elite is, I paid £100 for the game at midnight on release, I have purchased every COD game, every map pack and every year i get a T-Shirt to be extra nerdy! in return for my loyalty and love for activision I get shit service, shit resolutions and no prize when I win one (L)

2) Hopefully this will blow up (fingers massively crossed) and Activision will see this, not only allowing me to win my argument with them but also to hopefully better their customer service as a overall result! 

and most importantly... 

3) To stand up and fight a company that has done this to dozens of people, I have spoken to 3/4 prize winners in the same boat and its sickening! a company worth billions cant even send a prize worth pennies to them to loyal deserving customers! 

Please Guys & Gals please upvote for the sake of past present and future elite prize winners! you never know one day you could be one yourself and have the same shitty time I am. 

Much love,

Call me a Legend,My list of favourite games ever is very unique... I need help finding similar games,"Hello reddit

  
As stated in the title, at first glance my list of favourite games is very odd. You would expect someone's list to contain similar games, indicating that this person appreciates a certain genre. However, my list of top 6 games is:

  
- Elden Ring

- Outer Wilds

- Hollow Knight

- The legend of Zelda BOTW/TOTK

- Subnautica

- TES Skyrim

  
In no particular order. This list contains: a souls-like, a space exploration game, a 2d metroidvania, an adventure game, an underwater survival and an RPG.

  
Then you might ask: what connects these games? And, to me, the link is: none of these games have a giant arrow in your screen telling you where to go. None of them have an NPC telling you what you're supposed to do now. None of them have a mission called ""Kill 34 metal gargoyles to build a new base""

  
All these games just throw you at a giant open world, no direction, no closed route. They don't even tell you what is your end goal (except for the two LoZ entries). Just you and a huge world. I have spent over 100 hours in vanilla Skyrim and I have never killed the ""final boss"", because it felt unimportant. I have spent 60 hours in subnautica just exploring every corner, looking under every rock. I have spent 120 hours in Elden Ring doing... Huhhhh... I don't even know what I was doing. I'm not even sure how many bosses there are, and how many I have killed. I was just exploring. 



And Hollow Knight...  Jeez, if I had to pick a top one of this list, even though it would hurt me, it probably would be HK. Such a wonderful, rich, unique world

  
I have played other metroidvanias, other RPGs, other adventure games, but they never scratch the same itch. My question is, are there other similar games, providing similar experiences?

Call me a Legend,Do I get a Nintendo Switch or a Steam card,"Got a decent amount of money for Christmas. Conflicted on what to get. I love gaming on pc but Legends Arceus and the new Pokémon games are calling my name as well. Help me decide, Reddit.",0,15,1672045296.0
Call me a Legend,"Gamers of Reddit, are you, like me, disappointed with the current selection of video games?","I'm almost 30 now and remember back when I was younger being filled with awe over games like Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, every zelda game on N64, Rygar, The Elder Scrolls, and many other adventure and rpg entries. Now, while browsing through available games, I'm super disappointed. It seems that the bulk of games are overwhelmingly first person shooters. I've done the first person shooter thing. For me, it gets really old. Endless matches of point and shoot. I want to experience moral dilemma like Fable used to provide or experience the birth of a super hero or villain like Infamous does.

It seems to me that games now lack depth. Everything is a reskin of call of duty or fortnight. Great games like Paragon and Gigantic fell by the wayside unable to survive as gamers flocked to deathmatch shooters. I dont understand the fascination and I'm starting to lose interest in my most favorite hobby of all time. Why do developers seem to lack the ability to craft a new, innovative game with rich story and deep lore? Anyone care to chime in? Maybe suggest something to get me out of my slump? Let me know your thoughts.",1,78,1570653016.0
Call me a Legend,What type of gamer are you?,"Hey everyone let’s see what type of nerds we got here yeah? Maybe some ppl can find a buddy in the comments or something. But I’ll go first for me.

I am a serious type and also competitive gamer. So I play games like overwatch or apex legends or valorant or league of legends and I’m a sweat and I don’t like communication to be filled with nonsense only call outs. Tho if we’re playing just for fun at the moment and casually like on Minecraft or something than I’ll just talk and talk trying to build chemistry with the person or people. But I’m also serious in games like battlefield like it I got a squad you gotta give callouts and stick together and such.

I also prefer nontoxicity like if a teammate made a mistake no kicking them from the party or calling them shit or something you know? It’s one game people make mistakes just give them some positive reinforcement and they’ll be better.

That’s how I am. Now how are you with gaming?",6,26,1638316766.0
Call me a Legend,Which games are masterpieces to you but isn't considered as such.,"This can be for various reasons and of course a lot depends on personal taste as well. So don't judge me for my choices, this is also about your choices or other peoples choices.

It would be nice if you explain why you think the games you selected are masterpieces

This is my selection.

**Hitman codename 47** The very first hitman created a whole new way of stealth gameplay, but also gunplay with the third person lean mechanic. It also introduced a new type of ragdoll physics, which worked amazingly when you moved bodies. Well I don't need to explain hitman, but the first hitman game wasn't so well received. I still think it is the best hitman, if you can look past the dated graphics.

**Lord of the rings war in the north:** Many lord of the ring fans were not happy with this game, at least that was the word in the wild if you asked around about the mediocre review scores. Still, to me it had amazing artwork and presentation. The loot system was very addictive, and the gameplay was just great fun overall, especially because you could play in three or two player co op.

**Worms 4 mayhem** (and not ultimate mayhem because it misses a key feature (wormpot) to customize games) You could create games that lasted for hours which were very strategic. The 3d way of playing worms may seem a bit off when you're used to the 2d version but it can create a lot more depth for gameplay, not to mention the game looks pretty good in general, even for such an old game. It has a funny story mode as well.

**Spartacus legends**: we all know fighting games and many of the styles are set in stone. Spartacus legends was original with the gladiator style of fighting by creating a good fighting system around it. It also had quite a good blood and gore system.

The game had a sort of rpg mechanic in how you could unlock armor, weapons but also level up your character in general. I haven't seen a fighting game implementing it this well.  It also had a tie in with the popular spartacus series.

It was made by a small developper called kung fu factory and published by ubisoft. Sadly they delisted the game 2 years after release and I've never seen another game quite like it anymore.",8,44,1674456674.0
Call me a Legend,On Valve's rumored new PvP shooter game,"If Valve think TF2 players are going to give Deadlock a chance because they trust the quality of Valve products and understand that one can't keep making sequels to the same thing, and that they are happy that Valve is once again putting their touch on the genre they popularized and bringing their trademark extreme innovation to it,  
they're mistaken.

I, for one, don't think this is real. It could be, but given Valve's ethos of staying on the cutting edge of technology (hence why they aren't updating TF2), this looks generic. Unless the gameplay is radically different from what I speculate, this looks like a Valorant clone. Which is interesting, because Valorant was inspired by Counter-Strike and Overwatch, Overwatch being inspired by TF2. (Quote from Jeff Kaplan: ""One of our greatest inspirations was definitely the Team Fortress series of games \[...\]"")  
I don't think Valve would pour this much into a game if it wasn't revolutionary. They know the expectations people have, with how all their previous games were groundbreaking, but this looks like something that a million studios could offer, including the already established Valorant. Could be wrong, especially the screenshot mentioning lanes makes me think of League of Legends, so there might be a bigger focus on defense, but we'll see.  
While I'm not buying into any leaks until it's made official (Nintendo fan PTSD), I would give it a try. Valve should make this free-to-play and release it on multiple platforms, but give Steam players preferred treatment.

Call me a Legend,"""Adam, Nintendo's on the phone...it's about Super Mario RPG"".","In 1996, I bought Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. Playing through the game was an experience unlike anything I had ever had. It was my first role playing game. I was twelve years old, and I sometimes struggled with more challenging games. In came the Nintendo Hotline. I had called them before, and they had always been very helpful.

Until, that is, I reached Culex's door. I was unable to defeat Culex, and I tried several times. Then his door disappeared. Gone. Completely gone. I called Nintendo, not knowing how to re-enter the fight. I had played this game through its near-entirety, and to have a major boss  battle be wiped from the map was ... unfortunate. The representative who answered the line claimed they had never seen this happen. They put me on hold. Another rep picked up the line, to make sure I was in the right area. Unable to give me an answer, they took my phone number and hung up the phone.

Several hours later, a phone call. ""Adam, Nintendo's on the phone..."" I couldn't believe it - they had found an answer, and *actually* called me back. As a twelve year old who had immersed himself in the world of Nintendo from age four, receiving a phone call from NINTENDO was a huge deal! I was thrilled. But...they couldn't help me. ""I'm sorry, but we've never had anyone with this problem before. There's nothing we can do for you and nothing you can do to get the door back"". That was fifteen years ago. I never saw Culex again. I'm still not entirely sure if my problem was rare, glitched, or what. That said, men and women of reddit, did **you** defeat Culex? Or did his door disappear before you had the chance? And why couldn't Nintendo give me an answer?",91,83,1314288082.0

GW2,  
Minecraft,  
The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap",2,29,1553149380.0
Call me a Legend,Pokemon Black and White are really good,"I’ve never been super into Pokemon. I grew up with Gen 4 (Platinum specifically), and I’ve enjoyed my time with some of the other games, specifically Gen 1-3, but I’ve never been a mega fan. I dabbled in just enough of Let’s Go, Gen 8, and Legends Arceus to know they just aren’t really for me. I admire this series, but I’m not too big of a fan.

However, I’ve been having a bit of a Pokemon itch recently, so I decided to branch out and try Pokemon Black. I have no idea where the general consensus on Gen 5 sits today, whether it be closer to the mixed response the games had at launch or the resurgence the games have seem to had within the Pokemon fanbase (at least from what I’ve seen) that has reassessed this Gen as one of the absolute best. However, from just the little bit I’ve played (about 7 and a half hours, so these are just early impressions), I think this generation is super cool.

It may be easy to forget given the state of the franchise on Switch, but there was a time when Pokemon represented the peak of what handheld gaming was capable of and Gen 5 is no exception. This game looks incredible for the DS. The overworld sprites are charming and detailed and the use of 3D for the backgrounds not only gives the games a strikingly unique look, but the game goes all out with some camera angles. I like the lower camera angle present in the game’s Pokemon centers. Castelia City goes all out with the camera angles and it’s wildly impressive for the console. There’s also small pieces of polish I really love. Almost all the Pokemon are animated in battle now (to be fair, I don’t know if this was added in Heart Gold and Soul Silver), your rivals have animations before battle (I especially love Bianca struggling to get a Pokeball out), and calls over the Xtransceiver are really cute.

Now to talk about gameplay. The biggest change in Gen 5 has proved to be incredibly divisive. The Unova region contains 156 Pokemon, all of which are new to the series. All of the Gen 1-4 Pokemon do return, but you can only obtain them in the post game. While I understand wanting to use your favorites in the main story, I kinda love this. Not only have there been 2 mainline DS Pokemon games already that allow you to fight with your favorites (3 after Gen 5’s sequels came out), but a brand new roster gives Gen 5 a discovery factor the series hasn’t had since Gen 1. If you haven’t played Gen 5 yet, it’s probably the closest you’ll get to discovering your first Pokemon game where everything feels new and unfamiliar and exciting. I also do like a lot of their designs.

In terms of battling, it’s pretty interesting. I’ve always found Pokemon to be brutally simple and it’s always what turned me off about the series. I do not know what’s happening this time though, but I’ve been consistently finding myself overwhelmed by Gen 5. I do not know enough about the series to tell if it’s due to mechanics and changes introduced in Gen 5 or just a result of me getting properly into the series for the first time as an adult, but I find the depth of battles and breadth of things to do overwhelming. For the first time, 6 Pokemon with 4 moves feels like not enough space. While the early game still isn't as in depth as something like an SMT game, things do open up. 

I don't want to say that Pokemon Gen 5 is objectively more difficult or anything like that, but I've certainly lost more Pokemon in trainer and gym battles than previous games, where I normally just steamrolled through everything. Maybe it has something to do with my team setup or wanting to get more out of the mechanics, meaning I'm making bad decisions. Stuff like going for status effects or stat boosts when I should just be attacking (previously, I would basically discard any moves that don't do damage).

Anyway, I've been having a good time so far. After all these years of being more of a series admirer from a distance, it feels good finally finding the generation for me and hopefully opening the doors to get more into the series. I do want to give Legends Arceus another shot one day.",6,14,1723334521.0
Call me a Legend,Why does League of Legends have such a toxic community?,"So, a friend has been trying to get me into League of Legends, and some of it has been pretty fun. However, I have noticed that as I go up in levels and play more PvP (read: no bot) games, it seems the community becomes incredibly toxic. Is this the norm of this?

I am used to a little bit of the 'bad egg' in games from time to time (Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, etc), but it seems so much more prevalent in League of Legends than elsewhere. I can honestly say this is the first time I have actually been witnessed to not one, but two death threats from two individuals (or a call for suicide).

This isn't a request for any sort of hug-boxing. It is just really annoying to go into a game after a very long day of work, to be berated by folks on your own side. It just seems so much more common in League of Legends than in other places I have been.

Does this toxic sludge just get deeper the higher you go in the game?",8,53,1415595627.0

Call me a Legend,Name games most people like but you dislike,"Let's share some opinions on popular games or franchises that are generally praised and regarded as really good titles, but that you dislike for whatever reason (provide details, please :D)

I'll start:

\- Final Fantasy series: I love RPGs, but for some reason, these games and I never really clicked. The stories are awkward (like most JRPGs, actually, lol).

\- The Legend of Zelda series: never played them in my youth, never been interested, honestly. Maybe had more to do with the fact that I barely touched Nintendo consoles when I was young.

\- Metal Gear Solid series: I tried a couple of them, but got bored. I like stealth and action, but the story was a bit too weird for me. I never find Kojima's games very engaging plot-wise.

\- Dishonored: considered one of the best modern stealth titles, got bored really quickly, mainly due to having to restrain myself from killing enemies or fighting. I know you can totally go that route, but the fact that the game discourages you from doing so put me off.

\- Nier: Automata: See Final Fantasy.

\- Any Moba. This includes League of Legends, Heroes of the Storm, Dota, etc.

\- Any Battle Royale. When I play action online competitive games (such as Call of Duty or Counter Strike), I never play search and destroy modes because I like to jump right back into the action after being killed, not having to sit and wait for the rest of my team to save the round. For me, Battle Royales are kind of like that.

\- Bloodborne: The only reason I'm including this one here is because I've beaten and LOVE the rest of From Software modern action RPG games: Dark Souls 1-3, Sekiro and Demon's Souls. Bloodborne is considered by most From Software fans as the best title in the Soulsborne series, but for me... meh. Maybe it was the setting, I don't know (I prefer medieval fantasy).",0,42,1628090239.0
Call me a Legend,Why are some people so aggressive with game preferences?," 

So, I just got bashed for my gaming preferences on the Switch. 

The main thing I said was that I preferred playing Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword HD over Breath of the Wild. I've owned Breath of the Wild for a few months now and only put about an hour into it, I played Skyward Sword for about 10 hours so far.

Most people were understanding and respectful, except for a few who got a bit aggressive. I was basically told that I must be some stupid child (I'm 18) that doesn't know what a good game is. Some of the nicer people also asked me what other games I prefer.

I answered with more indie games such as Spiritfarer, Coffee Talk and A Short Hike as examples. As well as some AAA games like Fire Emblem Three Houses, Pokemon Shield, Mario Golf: Super Rush and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. A few aggressors used these examples to basically call me a p\*ssy for not liking games such as Smash Brothers, a game which I put about 5 hours into the story mode.

I know that the gaming community is usually very good, but why are some people so aggressive about others gaming preferences?

I really don't want to start a fight over this either, everyone is entitled to their opinions. I just want to discuss with the community on why this could be a thing.

Thank you in advance for reading.",5,33,1627586232.0

I don't know if I'm what Epic would call a Whale, but I do acknowledge that I've spent quite a bit on it and don't mind the term. 

I've spent well over $2,000 on Fortnite. Yes, I know it's a lot, but it is over 5 accounts. Mine, my wife's and 3 boys. This figure also accounts for STW mode purchases too. So I don't really think it's that bad. 

I also dont think I'm addicted like they suggest as I've thought numerous time to buy the Frozen Legends pack, but have yet to commit. I actually almost want to buy it because I think its leaving soon and I want to get it in case I change my mind later and am screwed. All the more reason to know I'm  not actually addicted because I am actively choosing to decline. I also pass on many things. I think they rib me out of fun, but it has made me curious

My total is a legit consequence of cosmetics one of us wants and then the whole squad will get matching sets... We all like to match sometimes and This shit adds up fast, we all know this.

So, 2 things: 

First: With that in mind, am I at least semi-justified in the reason for the total amount? Also, it goes without saying that we are aware of people can do what they want with their money and all of my bills are paid and we have food and utilities... LOL

Call me a Legend,Does anyone know of any examples of Zelda-like games that prioritize the story over gameplay?,"I've been a big fan of the *Legend of Zelda* game franchise since childhood, and am looking forward to *Tears of the Kingdom*. That said, I'm not a franchise purist, and have admired so-called ""*Zelda* clones"" that take the foundation that the franchise has left and build upon it to make for a unique experience.

Shigeru Miyamoto once said that whenever a new *Zelda* game is thought up, the first thing they do is focus on the gameplay, and then build the story from there - in a way, the story is more of an ""afterthought"" than anything else.

That got me curious, what ""*Zelda* clones"", if any, take the opposite approach?

Are there any worthwhile games similar to the *Zelda* series that have been developed in such a way that the story takes precedence over the gameplay (not to say that the gameplay isn't still important, because it is)? I've thought about this, but I can't think of any examples (admittedly, I haven't played many ""*Zelda* clones"").

If anyone knows of any such examples, please let me know in the comment section below.",0,22,1664851737.0

Call me a Legend,"Despite everything, being a WoW player has been an experience like no other","I know Blizz isn't popular nowadays but I was talking to my wife about this and I wanted to share my thoughts here.

I've played WoW on and off since vanilla. I've never been an end-game player. I come from Warcraft III, I've always been here for story and solo play, other than about half a year during TBC up to WoTLK with some intense WPvP as I co-ran a such guild.

And friends, it's been a journey. I've played other games for long periods but WoW? It's been something else.

First, vanilla itself was a journey. Coming from WCIII, seeing all the locations you saw in the game was mindblowing. I can go to STRATHOLME??!! The haunted throne room above Undercity, Orgrimmar, Theramore, exploring all these locations, seeing Thrall or Jaina in game, running into Misha accidentally and soiling my pants thinking it's a boss, then realizing I just met Rexxar, finding Varimathras in Undercity being totally on our side (foreshadowing)... So much good stuff.

We also started learning about Titans and WHAT? DWARVES WERE EARTHEN? WHAT THE HEEEEELLLLL!!

After dealing with a lot of smaller stuff in all the regions, you go to fricking Plaguelands. You see the mind-blowing Sillithid hives in Sillithus. End-game areas were majestic.

And then, you joined the War Effort. To my knowledge, unseen in gaming. All the servers come together for the effort. That's some Kennedy moon speech level shit. I was low level when the gates opened and we had to deal with bugs even in Barrens?? IIRC.

So the world changes, after a one-time event. And I was there. Doesn't really matter if I was high level or did the gong. I wish I had seen that too but in a way, it was just me, a low level adventurer and suddenly we were fighting for the Horde and Azeroth. It was something.

Then the Dark Portal opened and powerful demons were unleashed and we found ourselves in Draenor. We found Khadgar and other heroes of the second war, we met the Mag'har, we had the conflict between Scryers and the boring faction, had a bunch of area PvP stuff, witnessed blood elven technomagic, fall of Kael'thas and then his return in the Isle of Quel'danas, which we built, step by step. Day by day, we contributed, we fought the demons (and each other, hollering at all Ravenholdt-EU peeps Horde and Alliance, we fought like crazy!) and created a strong foothold and took on the offensive.

FRICKING KJ WAS ALMOST SUMMONED INTO THE WORLD. Holy shit, that was close and it was a defense against a cataclysmic event (foreshadowing)

Oh btw, we met Grom's son, Garrosh. That's cool. (foreshadowing)

Next bit was fun in Raveholdt EU, as we found sus crates that carried some disease. First it was easy to cure but then it got worse and worse, turning the best of Azeroth into ghouls, horde and alliance alike. Frenzy of ghouls swarmed Orgrimmar and Shattrath (in RH at some point I think only the naaru and khadgar were alive in Shatt, simply because they were immortal) and finally with Argent help, we were able to push back both the disease and the flying ziggurat attacks on the capitals.

And then, it was time to push back. Fuck you Arthas. We even have Death Knights!! They are so fucking cool (and also OP initially) and their starting level is 55??! and they have a special area where they get to murder innocents and torture people? WELL COUNT ME IN, until LK betrays us and holy shit Tirion the side paladin from Vanilla seems so strong and WAIT IS THAT ASHBRINGER?!

Fight against Arthas was very personal to me as an undead player. It was time for revenge. We buried the hatchet and worked with the Alliance. Footholds on both sides, pushing towards the middle. Step by step. Killing powerful agents of the Lich King. Working on a plague that can destroy the Scourge (foreshadowing). Making allies in unexpected places. And then, we were at the Wrathgate. All this work we put in, all this effort. We finally will defeat Arthas... and in one of the most spectacular cutscenes ever (I appreciate Terran Gregory so much, he's also a super cool dude), we are betrayed. We fight for Undercity!!! Man they should really turn these into scenarios. But yeah, a splinter group attacks all and the tenuous alliance (reference to vanilla cinematic) is broken. Not only it's broken, it gets worse. Relatively newly returned hot headed King Varian and Garrosh guy keep clashing. Tensions are high.  Thrall and Jaina no longer leading the narrative. Neither is Anubarak because he's just a dungeon boss? Lame. (foreshadowing)

And we fight each other. Like damned fools. But we keep pushing too. We find more about Titans and that robot dude really looks like a gnome and Titans are what the what now? ALGALON IS SUPPOSED TO DO WHAT? Oh btw humans were GIANTS?! WAIT AN OLD GOD SITS THERE AND HIS BLOOD IS WHOOOAAAA

And then, Tirion is done with our bs. He starts the tournament. Again, we're there, every step of the way. We secure the area and build that. We then do the tournament so we recruit the best Azeroth has the offer and HOLY SHIT ANUBARAK AGAIN? Final boss in the penultimate raid, not so bad.

We have the best of the best now, btw Arthas' humanity is a ghost and we push through. What a fucking glorious raid and oh shit man, poor Saurfang. Blizz why are you making us shed tears in a fricking raid man. Varian is cool I guess. AND NOW EAT THIS ARTH- oh wait he's just killed us? OH WAIT TIRION OH WAIT HOLY COW PHEW.

And then... it was done. Sylvanas was so done that she threw herself to death and met some people on the other side or something, probably not important (foreshadowing) and came back with angels of death.

She raises undead now because undead are getting destroyed and not making babies. That's the reason. Really, Warchief. Shut up bish. Anyway, things looked actually good at this point EXCEPT FRICKING DEATHWING CAME and he riled up the elements and broke the world.

The world has transformed. There is no going back. Thousand Needles is a sea now. You had to be there to see when it was deserty and needly. (pun)

And now we meet a lot of tentacles, watch a painfully long fantastic-themed Indiana jones 2, do a dwarven wedding and voila, it's Ragnaros again (I think). Btw everyone's throwing themselves at Deathwing because of an achievement. Not ON him though. At him. (foreshadowing)

New Nelf leader no one cared about is evil and he turns Thrall into a ghosts of Ninja turtles. Thrall's bae and we go fix him. Another wedding happens, all the celebrities are there.

We go into firelands and kill Ragnaros again. IN HIS REALM. He done.

And we do some messy time travel shit like its a Knaak book, get a laser gun, jump ON Deathwing, jump on stones slapping tentacles and Thrall is Earth aspect now oder? Pew pew and dragons are now sucky. It be mortal time.

Mortal kombat more likely, because Garrosh is now Warchief despite EVERYONE telling Thrall not to do that and also Cairne is killed off-screen after having no screen time in WoW. That's the real murder I'm telling you. But also Garrosh didn't mean it. Not with poison. So Garrosh is portrayed like this asshole, but not evil. He's just too much into the combat-y ways of orcs, prolly because he has to fill in Grom's boots and feels bad he was sick during the invasion were legends are made. He is a hot head, but still honorable. That's why he personally killed a commander who killed innocents.

So, he decides to drop a mana bomb on Theramore and kill innocents tenfold. I feel this might be one of the you-know-who decisions that wrecked lore. Garrosh wasn't this. But anyway now he is.

And we go to Pandaria and fight and have fun yadayada. I mean I love MoP but there isn't much you can't experience EXCEPT GARROSH LAYING WASTE TO THEIR SACRED HEART. And it still hasn't healed back. Whole region transformed overnight.

Then Garrosh does the thing and things happened in the books and there is WoD and we go to Draenor and... well, this part is mostly experiencable I guess, except I don't think you can make the ring? But not much happened in WoD so whatever. Being there was cool though because you saw this FRICKING. GUL.DAN. NOT making any evil cliche mistakes. He always have protection spells, he's a step ahead, always have a henchman to throw at us... and even if we won at the end, KJ portaled him somewhere.

OH INTO LEGION. And this fricking Gul'dan TOYS with us, kills Tirion before our eyes and challenges us to a fight in an island, just like Arthas was challenged. And just like that, it was a trap. And we ran into it. Fool Varian thinks he can push through fricking 3242 bosses and gets himself killed for nothing. Gul'dan gets Varian and Zul'jin in his list and it's sad but we get artifaaacts baby! So it's fun but a grind but WHO GOES THERE? AN ILLUSION? WHAT ARE YOU HIDING? and we get FRICKING ILLIDAN??? AND WE HAVE FRICKING ARGUS IN THE SKY??!!!! And we go there and FIGHT A CORRUPT TITAN?? AND TITANS IMPRISON SARGE- WAIT IS THAT SARGERAS AND WHAT IS HE DOING WITH THE SW- OOOOOOOOOH SHIT. THE SWORD.

Well we drain our artifacts and they're gone and it's said but HOLY SHIT THE SWORD IS THERE AND AZEROTH'S BLEEDING. Diamond dwarf is there and shit I forgot to talk about old god whispers and how we've been sure about the interpretations every time and we were wrong or maybe not. But anyway. It's war time.

Sylvanas is super pushy for war but we're all for it and zappybois there and my boy saurfang's there and JAINA FLIES OVER BANGING THE IMMIGRANT SONG? (I'm sorry but that edit is headcanon) and Anduin's cool and jabs between him and Sylvanas are cool and we lost Und- We really lost Undercity.

Sylvanas is really getting on everyone's nerves but allies are annoying and jainas annoying and Wait Saurfang's recruiting Thrall? UNDEAD ROGUES ON CUTSCENE FUCK YEAH and.. yeah. War's over and Sylvanas betrayed us all. Even her loyalists. Because it's a thing now. And also using one shoulderpad like Saurfang. It is so in that blizz even implements it!! Like there is HISTORY behind that shit guys!

Anyway, I gues Sylvanas talking to helya was foreshadowing more than a lantern. Welp, we go to deadlands and do the things. This one's too close to feel like history and... I guess there isn't much historical value other than seeing some important people there? But I'm not sure if there is anything you can't experience anymore.

And then comes dragonflight.

This whole journey, spread out over two decades... and I played Mharla, my ud rogue and I started as a roleplayer and basically always have a ""rp"" in my mind. So it's been an amazing book/tv show for me.

I honestly don't think blizz has been doing half as bad as people shat on them storywise and regardless, ""being there"" and witnessing events unfolding, threads in early expansions leading to things in the future, seeing the world transform, witnessing things like one-shoulder pad, being there when we ""built"" Quel'danas, Tournament ground, did the War effort, I think Cata had something too... Or how we turned into ghouls in Ravenholdt and scoured the cities of people XD I mean it was mean I guess but also so much fun. And I'm sure I missed so many things. Like stealth runs! There was a thing called a stealth run where rogues and druids stealthed through some locations in dungeons... and I think it stopped existing with WotLK?

It's really one of a kind and I appreciate blizz devs so much for the love and effort they put in the game and I appreciate the community (even if I'm not on the same page as some fellow redditors on the state of things) for making this happen because it could've only happened with us.

Anyway, that's me. WoW is such a unique piece of gaming and I wanted to share my view in it and that's not even getting into how it helped me forge friendships that went lifelong, how it allowed me to have a wider world view, helped improve my English to.. well, whatever level this is, how it provided me a safe space when I needed...

Call me a Legend,"What is, in your opinion, the least frustrating to play and least toxic competitive multiplayer game on the market?","I’m just looking for recommendations of new multiplayer console (PS5, Xbox, Switch) games to try. Most recent ones I’ve tried but didn’t love was Call of Duty, Halo, Paladins, Siege, and Apex Legends. Just played a few rounds of Fortnite against bots and had fun but I know the games with sweats will happen soon. I played a lot of Dead by Daylight but the player base is toxic as Hell and the gameplay not only allows, but encourages troll behavior. I find the best way to play it is to NOT play it but mess around.

The only multiplayer game I can see myself continuing to play for years is Overwatch. I’m not great at it but it tilts me the least and the player base isn’t THAT toxic (at least on console). And if a player is giving me grief I feel like I have options to counter it.

What are good multiplayer games to get into now? There will always be toxicity in multiplayer games, but which ones are, in your experience, the least toxic?",1,27,1642171334.0
Call me a Legend,Anyone else just really enjoying single player games over multiplayer at the moment?,"Disclaimer: I am 20 years old, and play all types of games. (Sorry for the long post but please stick with me, I want to know what other people’s views are)


Let’s start with the obvious: we were absolutely spoiled in 2018 with story based single player games. God of War is now my all time favourite game, Red Dead Redemption 2 was a masterpiece in storytelling, Spider-Man had what I think is the best version of the character, Assassin’s Creed Odyssey pushed the bounds of RPG and open world beyond what we thought was possible. These are just a few that I adored over the past year. 

Multiplayer games have taken a turn for me. Toxicity has been around forever and there’s no escaping it. Games like Call of Duty, Fortnite...they have horrible player bases. You can’t go 5 minutes without a kid calling you a gay c*** and telling you to go f*** your mum. It’s just horrible. 

I feel like the gameplay has dropped a little too. Maybe this is because of all the BR games that have come out recently (this could be why I’m getting bored). It just feels samey all the time. Even in PES 2019 I have completely lost interest in it because of the gameplay. 

I have fallen in love with Apex Legends which I think really has some great gameplay elements, but if I play online now, I much prefer playing with friends on calm and relaxing games such as Steep or even one of my groups recent favourites: Golf With Your Friends. 

Maybe I’m just getting older and prefer spending time being invested in story and characters as a side effect of that. Maybe BR is destroying multiplayer. Maybe I’m just whining about nothing. 

Please leave your thoughts as this is something I really do care about and want to know more peoples views on. ",60,64,1550688618.0

Call me a Legend,"Two nights ago, I set out on a mission","11 years ago, I first picked up a PlayStation 1 controller. It felt good in my hands, the controls were easy to reach, so I felt happy. Dad popped in a game. That game was 'Spyro the Dragon'.

It seemed frustrating at first, but after reading the instruction booklet that came with the game, it became much easier. I could now breathe fire, soar around the land, charge at enemies. I was in control of something. Every time I was at Dad's, I picked up that controller, stuck that game in, and played. It was easily my favourite game for the system, even if I never beat it. Probably because of that, actually.

A few years later, Dad got an XBox. The controller didn't feel as nice, but it was still comfortable; and so, armed with that and a copy of 'Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge', I played that. Whenever I could, though, I'd reconnect the PS1 back up to the old TV and resume the adventures of the little purple dragon and his best buddy Sparx.

This went on for several months, until eventually Dad saw no reason to keep the PS1, and as he was moving, he stuck it into storage. I don't even remember what happened there, but I knew I was sad. I loved that game so much, and the XBox just couldn't fill the gap. Kind of like Calvin and Hobbes being filled by every other comic strip ever. They're alright, but you pine for the good old days.

And so it was for many more years. Dad got an XBox 360, I never saw any reason to play it at all, I started high school, and so on.

Flash forward to September. Dad had moved again, and needed to sell some stuff so he could help pay off his debts. I was looking around, seeing if there was anything I'd like, when I saw it: the old PS1, covered in a fine layer of dust, the memory card still in the machine, a bunch of games nearby.

Ecstatic, I immediately sorted through the games, trying to see what I'd like. 'Asteroids'… 'Gauntlet Legends'… 'Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee'… when I saw it.

The game, like all the others, was a bit dusty, but after blowing it all off, it looked nearly perfect. Straight away, I decided to take those games back to Mum's place, since I had a newer model PSOne there.

I then checked that all the games were in working order. 'Asteroids' worked fine, although a little slower than I remembered; 'Gauntlet Legends' and 'Oddworld' worked fine; and then I came on to the last one. 'Spyro the Dragon'.

I opened the cover, set the disc down, closed it over, and hit the power switch. The familiar sound of the console starting up blasted from the speakers, and I hoped beyond hope that the game would still work.

A few seconds silence, and then I saw it.

A gnorc, climbing a mountain, stabbing it with an Insomniac sign, before my old friend swooped in, knocking him off, flying around, before setting back down with the logo coming up.

'Start Game' was flashing as normal.

I was so close to starting the game right then, but then I was called away for dinner. I turned it off, promising to myself that I would get back to it and beat it before the end of the year.

And then I forgot about it. For over 3 months.

Two nights ago, I found it again, and remembered my promise. I decided to fulfil it that very night, so I could finally finish the incomplete part of my life.

It started up again, and so without any doubt, I hit the X button, started a new game, and I was off.

As I played through each level, memories came rushing back. Of sitting down on Dad's couch, sweaty hands on a balmy summer morning, transfixed on the screen, on the characters. Of having to ask Dad for some help, because I'd been trying for ages, and I just couldn't get it. Of seeing Dad fail, but then realising what he was doing and then getting it right the very next time I tried it.

I played for six hours that night and got over halfway through before I was too tired to go on. I saved, hit the power button, got into bed and almost immediately fell asleep.

Last night, I was back. After a lot of reluctance, I had consulted a walkthrough, mainly since my impatience had gotten a lot worse since then. I made it through Terrace Village, Lofty Castle, and so many others I had never even seen before.

5 hours in, and I was getting super tired. But I was up to the final stage, I couldn't give up now. I pressed on.

Lives kept getting lost, game overs never seemed to cease, but I was determined. I made it to Gnorc Gnexus, died my way through Gnorc Cove, got shot at all the way through Twilight Harbour - and there I was.

The final level I had to beat to say that I had completed the game. Gnasty Gnorc.

I went in without hesitation.

I chased the thieves as fast as I could, grabbed the keys, and started chasing Gnasty Gnorc. My heart was pumping, my adrenaline was high, I was excited.

Don't get me wrong, I died a lot of times too. But that never deterred me. I kept going.

On Sunday, 16 December 2012, at 12:54 AM, after 6 more gruelling hours - twelve in total - I did it. I finished the game that I had loved for two thirds of my life.

I didn't care that it was a super easy boss fight. I didn't care that it was possibly the most anticlimactic boss fight in anything ever. I didn't care that the ending was terrible.

I had beaten the game. And for the first time in a long time, I was content.

I'm still reeling from finally having beaten this game. I used to dream about Spyro coming to my window at night and taking me for a ride. Maybe I'm crazy. But if I am, I wouldn't trade it for anything else. Except maybe a ride from Spyro.

Apologies if this isn't in the right place, but right now I'm too happy to care that much. Downvote and hate as much as you want, I won't notice or care.

tl;dr: I beat the first video game I'd ever played after 11 years since I first played it.

EDIT: *replies to heaps of comments* Good to see the nostalgias kicking in. I like that.

EDIT THE SECOND: Wow, it seems everyone has one of those games, don't they? That was really fun, and reading through those really made me happy. Thanks for that! I feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

I just made 20 kills in Apex Legends. For that you get a Badge as a reward. Its not easy to get this badge, no one from my friends got this Badge. 

&#x200B;

So when I finaly got the Badge, I told a good friend that I got the Badge. And you know what he said?:

&#x200B;

""Ok and?"" Acting like there is nothing special with it. 

Then he continiues:

""When I take a look and see that you play a gay spanish character without water, no, its not good""

&#x200B;

We talk about Octane in Apex Legends. He is a spanish/mexican character who can be annoying. My friend lives in Germany and laughs about the fact that he is spain and he read somewhere that in some parts of spain there is no water. He also calls him gay, but Octane is not gay. Its meant to be an insult.

&#x200B;

I am overweight. When I talk about Fitness or how I could change my life by drinking only water for example, they start to laugh. Like a fat guy telling me that he will drink only water?

&#x200B;

Another example: They used to be really social and friendly, but they got stuck. Its really hard to talk to them. 

&#x200B;

Hey, how are you?

""Hm"" or ""oh myusername""  (not asking me how I am)

Hey what should we play?

they: no answer

Me: Hey?

they: \*annoyed\*

&#x200B;

They also hate nearly every Country, if someone is doing bad in a video game they say something like ""of course he is from Romania, thats why he is so bad. They dont have a internet connection""

&#x200B;

I feel like I'm becoming just like them. Should I give up these friends and just live my own gaming life? Or am I doing something wrong´?",1,20,1650392409.0
Call me a Legend,What PS4 Games Should I Buy?,"Hi, so I'm considering buying one of those PS4 bundles with Uncharted 1-3 on them and was curious if anyone could recommend good games I may like. Up to this point in my life, I've been mainly a Nintendo fan, but I want to branch out and play some other games I can't get on my Wii U or 3DS. 

The game series I'm really fond of from Nintendo are Pokémon, Fire Emblem, The Legend of Zelda and Kid Icarus. Are there any good PS4 games that you would recommend for me similar to those? Or maybe there are series/games you'd recommend regardless to me. I really like fantasy and I'll try any genre, minus most Call of Duty-esque FPS' or Horror games. Please leave me any suggestions you may have and have a happy holidays!",1,31,1451110232.0
Call me a Legend,"The void in my Steam friends list, and why I choose to keep it there.","Link to post: http://akjinster.tumblr.com/post/14009660141/the-first

                                

The first thing I do when I log on Steam is open up my friends list and look for his username.  Because of the Kanji characters, it is always at the top of the list of offline friends.

I can’t help myself.  Despite knowing that he will never log on again, my eyes glance over to that grayed-out name every single time.

He was only 25.

By that time we hadn’t hung out in a while, and I occasionally texted him invitations that he would politely decline.  Those texts turned out to be the only way I could have found out that he had died.

One day I was surprised but happy to see that he was calling me back while I was grocery shopping.

“Hey, what’s up biatch?!  You finally gonna hang out with us or what?” I greeted him while waiting for the butcher to finishing packing a particular cut of beef.

The caller turned out to be his mom.  I cannot remember everything she told me, but I remember feeling extremely sad for her.  How many phone calls like this one did she have to make?  Her son had many friends.

    Someone said to me once, “We mourn the most when we see the pain of those left behind.”

I put the package of meat in my shopping cart and began to clench my jaw.  She told me that her son had passed away two weeks ago, and that she had looked though his phone and saw my many text invitations to him.  I began to have trouble breathing, and I could feel my girlfriend looking at me, worried.

When the caller thanked me for being such a good friend to her son, I completely fell apart. 

“I’ll be in the car,” I told my girlfriend, and with no further explanation, I walked outside, sat in my car and cried.

——-

He was only 25. 

When we worked together we would often hang out at his house.  He made it his mission to get me to overcome my dislike for pale ales, and would often have an assortment of different drinks for me to try.  After one particularly drunken night, we found ourselves racing around his neighborhood on bicycles.  I was still wearing my work slacks, which got stuck in one of the chains and made a huge rip that exposed one of my butt cheeks.  He laughed so hard that I won easily.

Games, competition, and drinking were what we had in common.  He was always trying to learn something new, and whenever he found it, he latched on completely.  Obsession would be too light a word to describe what he felt.

His capacity for learning was only matched by his enthusiasm to share what he had learned.  When he decided to pick up the game of Gin Rummy, he devoured the book One of a Kind, a biography of the greatest Gin Rummy player and three-time World Series of Poker Champion Stu Unger.  The very second after he finished reading it, he messaged me on AIM.

    piequalsthreee: dude.  duuuuuudeeeee.

    genei jinster: ?

    piequalsthreee: stu ungar is the fucking MAN

    piequalsthreee: what’s your address?

    genei jinster: uh, you’ve been here tons of times, don’t you know the general area?

    piequalsthreee: only with my car.  im biking over right now.  you need to read this book

An hour later at 11 pm he showed up sweating bullets at my door with the book in hand.  His excitement was too infectious for me to deny.  Over the next few weeks, we would play hundreds of games of Gin Rummy on Yahoo! Games and then discuss how Stu Ungar was the fucking MAN.  We also went through Omaha Hi/Low and Go in similar fashion.

When he lost his job (due to circumstances outside of his control), we hung out much less in person, but much more online.  His passion at that time was Counterstrike, so I would hop on Steam with him.

    Greater indeed are the pleasures that are shared. - R.A. Salvatore

Anyone who has played a game with a friend knows this feeling.

——-

He was only 25.

When he turned his attention to competitive cycling, I was updated constantly.  He lost thirty pounds in a month, which would have scared me if it was anybody but him.  His focus was the stuff of legends.  He even stopped drinking (heavily) as part of his training.

After about three months he took a nasty spill which tore off a chunk of his upper arm.  He couldn’t even wait until he was out of the hospital before he e-mailed me the disgusting pictures.  The estimated time to recovery was about two months.

The problem was that even if his body recovered, his bike was completely ruined.  With hospital bills and a lack of a steady job, he lacked resources to get a new bike that would be up to his competitive standards.

Still, I wasn’t too worried.  I figured he would move on and find something else to occupy his mind.  I underestimated both his injuries and his passion for cycling as he began to withdraw from contact.  He was on AIM and Steam less frequently.  I never hung out with him in person since the accident.  The few times I did have contact with him, he spoke of drinking heavily.

Soon contact with him trickled down to occasional text messages, mostly centered around holidays.

His mom told me that the cause of death was the mixture of alcohol with his painkillers for his arm injury.  Apparently he was so drunk that he had forgotten he had already taken his painkillers and took an extra dosage.  He then laid down to sleep and never woke up.

——-

We mourn the most when we see the pain of those left behind.  It took a long time for me to realize that I was one of those people left behind, and I was essentially feeling sorry for myself.  I had to move on, and to anyone watching me, I seemed to.

Yet I was not prepared to face the digital ghosts of my friend.  It started with the Steam friends list, which showed the last time someone had logged on to the account.  Three weeks ago, it read.  As the days passed I continued to glance at it as it increased in length.

I thought about all the e-mails I had from him.  These were more then preserved memories; these messages still existed.  They aren’t relics from a past age.  If I ignored the timestamps these messages could have been sent a couple of minutes ago.  That was very, very difficult to wrap my head around, and I erased and un-erased all of his messages many times.

This is how death works these days.  We leave behind a digital footprint that cannot be altered by optimistic hindsight.  Our current thoughts, dreams, hopes, and ambitions are perpetuated till eternity, or more likely—a server goes down.

Three months after his passing, I was still trying to decide whether or not to delete his usernames, e-mails, and message logs.  Then a pop-up box appeared on the lower right of my screen saying that he had logged on to Steam.  My heart jumped even though I knew it was most likely someone simply turning on his computer, causing Steam to auto-load.  Sure enough, after a few minutes the account had logged off.

I then did something I was avoiding up until then; I went through all the old e-mails and chat logs with him, and it was the complete opposite of what I had been fearing.  Instead of being haunted by these messages, I began to laugh and smile at the memories of all the stupid things we did together.

I found myself once again enthralled by his constant enthusiasm and how he had no shame in sharing it with the world.  Looking back on my own life, I had acted in a completely different manner to the world: I tried to hide my passions to avoid potentially being mocked.

Now it is easy to see how stupid I was acting.  Sharing my passion for something to another person is one of the most gratifying feelings in the world.  Even if others don’t quite understand it, they see my enthusiasm and become at least a little intrigued.

When I realized that I could share the things I loved to the world, it felt as if a great weight lifted from me.  I know now that I don’t need to convert everyone (or anyone) to the things I enjoy.  Satisfaction comes from not having to hide my hobbies and obsessions due to some misplaced fear of being judged.  Often those who pass judgement are themselves guilty of not being true to the world.

These days I keep his name on my friends list to remind me to not be ashamed of the things I enjoy.  Every time I log on and see his name I think:

He was only 25, yet he taught me so much.

Rest in peace.",998,228,1323557720.0
Call me a Legend,Looking for a new game recommendation,"I have a 6 year old who is really into adventure type games.  I probably let him watch me play Elden Ring a little too much because now he’s really itching for a game where he can fight monsters with swords.  Looking for something on the Switch.  

He’s obsessed with Legend of Zelda and Pokemon, so naturally we’ve already played through all those franchises have to offer.

I saw a game called Portal Knight but don’t know much about it.  Mainly looking for something that would be appropriate for a kid where he gets to adventure with swords and other weapons.

Call me a Legend,The mind of a toxic gamer...,"I had a player today in a League of Legends say to my teammates (in verbatim with only typos fixed), ""I hope your mothers all get cancer.""


I hope your mothers all get cancer.. over a video game. I mean, usual toxicity doesn't really bother me, as it's not often directed at me. Even then, I don't mind. But... I just can't understand how, because of someone's actions in a video game, something which is 100% inconsequential to real life, any rational person in a nice country (OCE, so Australia or NZ), would think to write to someone, ""I hope your mother gets cancer."".


So an honest question: If you're a flamer/toxic, how is you think it's normal to tell someone you hope they kill themselves, or that their parents get cancer, or call them whatever word you use that we all know you'd 100% never use to someone face to face? I mean... do you think that is acceptable behavour? The ends justify the means, they are bad so the should be insulted? Or 'it's only the internet'? Or what?


Just curious... this one for some reason got to me, probably because I know people who've passed away from cancer, and that shit just isn't cool. (when used as a 'I hope you get cancer' style, I understand 'this champ is cancer', or something. Cheers!",0,69,1467026711.0
Call me a Legend,Online Co-Op Story Games?,"So me and my friends have been playing games together for a while - GTA Online, Red Dead Online, Minecraft, Ghost of Tsushima, and so on. Our favorite parts of games are the story obviously, and games such as Ghost of Tsushima and RDR2 are very well known for having spectacular storytelling - in their solo campaign. Sure, there are story modes in GoT Legends, Red Dead Online, etc. but it’s difficult to care about them since they’re clearly tacked on and your character is either mute, doesn’t talk much, or doesn’t even have a personality and is purely a vessel for battle. What are some of the best online games with good storytelling? A few that have come up are Borderlands (A game we’ve tried and dislike), and games like Minecraft and Don’t Starve Together, where the story isn’t the main focus. The best example I can give you is actually Ghost of Tsushima: Legends’ 2 player story mode or Call of Duty’s Online Campaign (although we aren’t the biggest fans of FPS). Does anyone have any suggestions?

But now it's used as an insult device.  Oh you don't play fortnite, apex legends, pubg, call of duty, or minecraft, oh you're not a true gamer.

It really pisses me off that those games are dominating the market.  It's stifling creativity due to every dev getting on what's trending train, and it's making good games obsolete in the market.

Call me a Legend,I’ll keep this simple. What was Call of Duty thinking!? Lmaooo 100gb updates!?,"Lmaooooooo why make the best call of duty in years just to have this kind of massive roadblock. I had call of duty since it came out and never regretted it once.. until these updates. My god, the ps4 is at the end of its lifespan no ones paying over 100 dollars for an external hard drive just for call of duty. It’s literally to the point where both me and my Roomate cannot keep the game downloaded because it means having to delete nearly every other game into ps cloud. No exaggeration. So we both thought let’s settle for warzone, it’s free and separate anyway. Nope it’s free but comes with a nice solid 100gb pack of extra space . It’s ridiculous. It’s not like you can just delete something real quick and re download cod either. Because that’s a 3-8 hour wait on normal high speed. What a total shit show of a job on the various companies parts in this for approving this type of bold disregard for gaming experience. There’s no refunds or anything nor do I want one.

Call me a Legend,Started an Adventure with my son,"Alright, I didn't know who else would appreciate this, but I know some of you will. Last night was hanging out with my seven year old son and he asked me, out of the nowhere, ""Dad, what is your favorite video game?""  Most of the games I play are not appropriate for a seven year old, and I had to think for a second before I landed on, ""It's Legend of Zelda, Ocarina of Time."" 

""Can we play it?"" He asked. 

""Why not?"" I responded. We have the remastered edition on our Nintendo Wii, (This is the most recently released console that's not wrapped up under our Christmas tree in our house.)

So we boot up the Wii and get the pro-controller plugged in and there is no response, the buttons aren't working. 

""Well, we might not be able to play this one today,"" I said with a frown.

""That's okay, what's this one?"" he asked as we returned to the main menu. 

""Oh, we could do that one. That only requires a wii-mote,"" I smiled as I clicked on the Original Legend of Zelda. 

This is a game I, sadly, have never played more than a few minutes of. 

So we started his first profile, put his name in and pulled up a map and a guide online. (I didn't want to get stuck and have him lose interest.) 

It started with me doing most of the work on the controller. He wasn't confident enough to go onto a screen full of enemies and try to swing his sword. 

We followed the guide and got up to six heart containers, got the white sword, got the blue ring, got the enchanted shield, and were on our way to the first dungeon. He had taken over the controller and I had spent the last hour as support and to direct him with the map. It was getting late and I had to get up at 4:40 in the morning for work so I said, ""Let's call it for now, we will tackle this dungeon tomorrow, okay?"" 

""Yeah!"" he responded, rubbing his tired eyes. 

""Okay, let's die and we can save it,"" I instructed, not wanting to lose the hours of effort we had put in. 

This is where I messed up. He wasn't the most confident when it came to the controls in the menus, (Start menu and death screen). The controls are the Plus and the Minus buttons on the wii-mote for these areas. 

He dies, and I say, ""Okay, just go to 'Save' and hit the plus button and then we can do the dungeon tomorrow."" 

Well, he messed up and went to ""retry"" instead. 

Dang it. We lost about the last hour and a half of work, it hadn't been saved since he had taken over. 

""Well buddy, looks like we just lost most of our progress,"" I explained. 

""Oh, that's okay. I love this game. Let's do it again tomorrow,"" he responded without any hint of disappointment. 

tl:dr

BONUS: I'm about to have surgery on my shoulder in less than two weeks and will lose the use of my dominant hand for at least a month. If there is anything that is turn base or that I can point and click would be nice but I'll take any suggestions for before and after I'm healed from surgery. 

I'm on PC, he has a xbox one. (He also has an ipad? but I don't think there are really any games that cross into ipad territory but I could be wrong)

What he likes:

* Fortnite
* Fable
* GTA 5
* Call of duty
* Ratchet and Clank
* Spiderman games?
* Saints Row
* Crack down?
* Spryo?
* Crash Bandicoot

Games he absolutely will not play:

* Animal Crossing (Any thing that has this sort of style?)
* Smash bros
* Mortal Kombat
* side view fighter games ( idk his words)

What I like: 

* Animal Crossing (the older ones) lol
* Sims
* Zoo tycoon 2
* Skyrim
* The witcher 3
* Any Legend of Zelda
* Runescape lol
* Smash Bros
* Stardew Valley
* Empire Earth II

What I don't like:

* Battle Royale games
* Shooters",0,4,1674423268.0
Call me a Legend,Free 2 play should appeal to everyone (including people that want to spend money on it),"I'll explain. IMO Microsoft is the only company doing free to play right. (Killer Instinct and soon Fable Legends) I wouldn't even call it free to play because for me it's not because I never played KI's f2p version.

It works pretty much like League of Legends, you have free characters rotating and you can play with them every game mode, do all the achievements whatsoever. But here is the point. You can spend a certain amount (a reasonable amount, in KI's case its 40$ for both seasons) and you get EVERYTHING just like a normal game. I would much rather have League of Legends having its current model for people who don't wanna spend money on it. But why not let people pay lets say 50-60 dollars and have ALL the champions unlocked and skins being unlocked by playing or spending real money that's not even a problem. 

I am the only one that wants to be able to spend the price of a normal game on a f2p game to have just everything unlocked besides unlockables like skins?",3,25,1425943508.0
Call me a Legend,New underrated release: Tamarin (3D platformer),"Think of some weird meeting ground between Conker's Twelve Tales and Bad Fur Day... gorgeous environments and amazing soundtrack from DKC legend David Wise. Worlds are surprisingly big and branching. Game isn't oozing with personality or anything; it's more of an atmospheric experience for me.

It *is* a 3D platformer, but I'm also getting some Turok vibes how you can just get immersed and soaked in the atmosphere without a lot of cutscenes or anything; I'd call it a quality collect-a-thon - it feels like a PBS/NPR version of Conker lol.",2,0,1599954055.0

Call me a Legend,"I feel like people overuse the word ""toxic"" in online games","Specifically talking about competitive online games. I mean damn, when did people get so sensitive? People are constantly throwing the word ""toxic"" around left and right, it's just ridiculous now. People are always calling me toxic even though they're the ones throwing games for me. This happens everytime I play Rocket League and League of Legends, and Dota. Of course I'm going to be mad when I see someone throwing games for me and causing me to get demoted. There's a difference between being toxic and being angry. I'm just angry that I don't get rewarded for playing well because someone else on my team is awful at the game. It's even worse if someone's playing ranked and plays awfully bad, and then calls people toxic after he/she gets flamed. Some people just need to stay off of ranked mode if they're there to have fun. People like me take the game seriously and don't like it when people throw games. It's extremely infuriating and rage inducing.",0,18,1558129158.0

Call me a Legend,Last few months I reached a point I never wanted and thought would never reach,"**Edit: Thanks for all the comments and tips, some of them actually helped me realize a lot of stuff, haha. I'm going to try taking a break, reading some books I want, improving my skills for my job and stuff. Thanks again everyone!**

  
And that is: No games holds my attention anymore. I can open Apex Legends, R6, PUBG, Dota, Magic, GTA, various Switch games, even osu! and I get 30 minutes or less in the game and then close'em.

The last game that held me for a while was Fire Emblem Three Houses, I played it for around 50 hours, but after I got to part 2 of the game I kind of lost the urge to play. And I know that Fire Emblem is an excellent game!

Some of the games I'm excited to play are WoW classic coming out late this month, Call of Duty Modern Warfare (I'm a big fan of FPS) and Pokemon Sword / Shield but I'm afraid that these games will end up having the same fate as Fire Emblem.

Has anyone been through this phase? How did you deal with it? Or did how did you overcome?

Thanks",4,31,1564704826.0
Call me a Legend,It's my 15-year cake day and my 25th year in video games - Here’s highlights and lowlights as a video games professional and player,"It’s my cake day so after 15 years on Reddit I’ve decided to share some of my favorite moments in my career in video games and some of the worst (which many of them ended up on Reddit). Forgive the long post but heres a TL;DR, lets hope the mods allow me a post on my cake day about games, the business and my experience:

TL;DR: Celebrating 15 years on Reddit and 25 years in the video game industry, sharing personal highlights and lowlights from both professional and player perspectives. Highlights include significant career achievements and memorable gaming experiences. Lowlights cover notable challenges and mishaps, many of which have been shared on Reddit.

Ok buckle up for the randomness of 25 years in the video game industry as publisher, developer, publicist, and shill. Also forgive the run-ons, typos and nostalgia - its just proof that this is a real human not AI telling this story.

**First off, what did I do? I was a publicist for the video game industry for 2/3s of my career, creative/developer now. Let's start in the beginning.**

I worked in-house and at agencies throughout my 25-year career. What does a publicist do?Work with the press, celebrities, influencers, and partners to get people talking about a video game or franchise essentially for free—not advertising. We are in the persuasion business.The persuasion business is quite simply about presenting the game, its story, and the people who worked really hard to make it in the best light. That means picking and choosing when we show code, how we show code, what code is shown, and working with the developers to polish how they tell their story to players all around the world. We are storytellers, we are gamers ourselves, and we are often shot as the messenger.

A Note About The Press

The video game press, especially in the United States where I work and around the world where I supervised other publicists working in their territories and countries, are the most ethical people in the entire business of making games. Never in my 25-year career have I heard of or witnessed anyone buying a review. It's a ridiculous concept even to mention. We were 20-something-year-olds in an entertainment industry that was rapidly growing and, in some cases, on unlimited expense accounts where we could take our friends out for a good meal and a few drinks and talk about games. But with extra emphasis on this point, there is no steak, no cocktail, and no trip to a cool location that will ever make a bad game score any higher than it deserved per the opinion of the journalist. Now influencers are sometimes paid to hype and as entertainers, I’m cool with it. But journalists and Influencers are two different groups who we treated very differently. 

Back to my weird games career now…Nintendo

I started my career in 1999 working for Nintendo. This was the beginning of video games emerging from the toy aisle and establishing themselves as a challenger to the popularity of music, TV, and films.I am one lucky MF’r because my first career experience was working with the amazing PR agency that represented Nintendo in the US. My first big job sent me home on my first day with an N64, GB Color, and 20 games!!I got to help launch the GameCube, the GBA, and a bunch of incredible games like Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, Pikmin, Star Wars Rogue Squadron: Rogue Leader 2, Pokemon (Gold and Silver), Super Smash Bros Melee, Luigi's Mansion, Mario Kart, Advance Wars, Golden Sun, Animal Crossing, and a bunch of others.

One time, Nintendo sent me to New Orleans to attend Britney Spears' premiere for the movie Crossroads. At that party, we had some gaming stations set up, and I was there to man them. At the end of the night, I danced with her, Gwen Stefani and the rest of No Doubt, as No Doubt was the supporting musical act at the party, then ended up in a strip club with the guys from No Doubt, which felt super weird.

I have led a pack of 6 people dressed up as Pikmin around the Mall of America to help people carry their Christmas shopping.

I have led 400 kids in a Pokemon chant at E3 to welcome the creators of Pokemon to the stage. All of this was on CNN, which my mom saw, and she later called me and asked me if I was running for public office.

Joanna Dark and I delivered the first copy of Perfect Dark to the GameStop in Santa Monica Place. Shout out to all the Diamond Hands!!

I have also worn the Banjo-Kazooie costume at PR events.

Finally, the year that Nintendo debuted the GameCube, Mr. Miyamoto had cut his hand gardening a few days before and asked for some kind of glove to cover the cut. So if you know anything about LA, you know traffic is terrible. I drove around for 4 hours searching for a variety of gloves from designer to athletic to serve the purpose. When I finally showed up at his hotel, he was super appreciative but then decided that a band-aid would suffice.

The Long Forgotten THQ

THQ was my first foray into internal publishing (working in-house and not at an agency), and I got to work on some great titles ranging from Red Faction 2, STALKER, SpongeBob SquarePants to Warhammer 40K, and finally WWE Smackdown.

WWE was super cool because working with WWE Superstars is easy. They are employees of the WWE, so you don’t run into a lot of talent issues; you run into a lot of scheduling issues, but when they showed up, they showed out. Stacy Keibler was one of the best. She came by the booth at E3, signed autographs, and was exceptionally open to supporting whatever we needed from her during that E3.

One game I worked on called Alter Echo received the worst-ever review (deservedly) from EGM. I believe they said they would rather have their ass sewn shut and be force-fed prunes then play the game ever again. Pretty sure that was SeanBaby’s work, and while it made me laugh, it made it hell in the office for about 3 months.

Then there was the time when a couple of colleagues and I flew up to Oregon to meet Bruce Campbell, the star of the Evil Dead series, to film some promotional videos for Evil Dead: A Fistful of Boomstick. I'll never forget hanging around the campfire because Bruce really enjoyed our company and just talking about movies and video games. I’ll also never forget the intense flight through a thunderstorm where it felt like we’d climb 5000 feet then drop 5000 feet as we corkscrewed upward above the mountains that surround the airport, for the first 20 minutes of the flight I truly thought my last moments on earth we’re spent trying to properly remember the lines Klaatu Barada Nikto.

Another highlight of my time at THQ was getting to go to the Games Workshop headquarters in Nottingham, England. Nothing prepares you for it because it's truly a Warhammer fan's dream. That year, we were struggling to find an iconic image for the box cover of Warhammer 40k: Fire Warrior. I was being given a tour by our partner at Games Workshop, and I walked past an artist who was just sketching out a pile of skulls, and it struck me like a bolter. I said, “That's it, that's our cover,” and asked him if he could quickly rough out a fire warrior planted on top of the skulls. I scanned and sent it over to my marketing partner, and that became the cover of the game. 

Later in the campaign, I was working a 40K convention in Pomona with a buddy from THQ, and we were painting miniatures when some kid no older than 8 came up to me, looked at my mini, and said with complete disgust, “Two chain swords, I don't think so,” and walked away. 

Full Spectrum Warrior was an interesting game because it originally started off as a US Army training program that was basically X's and O's on a map that designated close-quarters combat situations for soldiers training. We partnered with an outside company because they saw a way to commercialize this Army training software and the Pandemic Studios who turned it into a game where turn-based meets shooter-style gameplay. I really enjoyed the concept because it was a shooter, but it was also thoughtful, had strategy, and created tension because of the close-quarters combat, which was all set in urban environments. It really made the player feel that situational awareness was the most important aspect of the game instead of twitch-like reflexes to pull the trigger.

I also got to work on the game STALKER, which was a game of the year candidate for a lot of critics. It was my first hardcore PC shooter, and I loved its dystopian take on the effects of radiation, the exclusion zones created by such radiation, and the survivalist story.

This is what I love about games—how art, story, music, sound effects, and code come together to make something truly enthralling. Game development is alchemy.

La société française de jeux vidéo a racheté le nom ATARI.

Now, when you're talking about Atari, you have to be clear that Atari has gone through many iterations and sales to other companies in its multi-decade history. I worked for two different iterations of the company run by two different investor groups at two different stages of my career. The first was the Infograms version of Atari, HQ’d in Lyon France.

Early on I was thrown onto all things anime which was fairly new to me at the time but then I got very fortunate to work on Dragon Ball Z Budokai 3. this was a fantastic fighting game in my opinion based off of a major IP but it was traveling around the country with its creators that truly taught me how Passionate the Dragon Ball Z fan base is And why it is a franchise that will last forever in games and TV and movies.

I also got to work on the Axis and Allies PC game which was pretty good but limited by Atari's lack of support for the franchise. I wanted us to put a lot more marketing dollars behind it but for strategy category games that was pretty unusual. I mostly wanted to use the money to rent a Sherman tank and drive around San Francisco delivering the games to editors but then again that might have landed me in jail. 

The Test drive series was a favorite of mine growing up and i got to work on Test Drive Eve of Destruction or something like that that was a fun game and I feel like it inspired the Psyonics team with its car based soccer mode but who knows everybody inspires everybody in this business and that's what makes it special and anyone who points out another developer and says hey that was mine is usually full of BS, and probably copying it from something else that they saw in a film, or another game. I desperately wanted to hold a demolition derby with journalists but legal stepped in and told us that that was impossible from a liability standpoint, what a bummer.

Vivendi Universal Games (which acquired Activision; not the other way around)

I moved on to the then called Universal Games, a division of the giant conglomerate of Universal which was itself a division of the even larger company called Vivendi  - so think music and film and TV. Now our sister company at the time was Blizzard and was definitely the darling of the company as the year I joined they released a little game called World of Warcraft.

While at Universal I learned a lot and got to do some really incredible things like I mention below like make television shows and throw experiential events. One of my favorite memories is when we acquired Activision we were all essentially let go and as part of the handoff we had about 6 months of just dead time and a good portion of us formed a small guild in World of Warcraft and raided nearly every day at work. We still got our jobs done and the handoff went really really well but we had time on our hands and that led to other shenanigans like forming an engineer's focused Rogue Guild whose mission was to gank lower level players in the most outlandish and ridiculous ways possible focusing on World of warcraft's most useless items and colorful displays of engineering weirdness. Those are some of my favorite memories of Gaming of all time.

Then there was this time our company was working with the Ghostbusters actors Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Ivan Reitman and more on a really fun Ghostbusters game. We created this launch event and invited Ray Parker Jr to play the theme song and figured he'd play some other songs too but once he got on stage he proceeded to play “Who you going to call?” over and over and over again. To this day I have nightmares to this track, also Dan Aykroyd was a pioneer in celeb booze biz with his Crystal Skull Vodka which he insisted we served at the event. Hey , Danny is a big ufologist.

Then there was the time I was loaned out to Interscope Records which was a sister company to Universal. The reason why I was loaned out is because we were publishing 50 Cent: Bulletproof and I was to work with 50 and G Unit to promote the game. I was always on the road on tour or doing work with Interscope, Vitamin water, Reebok and all of his other products and living the life on tour. He is the hardest working celebrity I've ever worked with and absolutely stands on business 24/7. I first met him in his trailer on the set of “Get Rich or Die Tryin.” He looked me up and down and asked me what my job was. I told him, he nodded and said “Alright, but next time I see you better be wearing my shoes and my fashion.” I was embarrassed realizing I was wearing Nikes and some jeans that my wife bought me. The next time I saw him I was fitted out head to toe in his gear, as a point to say that I represent his culture, his business and him.

One time at Madison Square Garden Lloyd Banks made a particularly big deal of giving the NYPD some shit while on stage. After the show, we got into our Suburbans to go back to the hotel and the Suburban that I normally took was with G-Unit but this time for whatever reason 50 Cent asked me to ride up front with him. NYPD knew exactly which Suburban Lloyd Banks was in and pulled that one over and found an unlicensed firearm in the vehicle and gave everybody a gun charge (which was dropped). I had an interesting conversation with Universal's lawyers after that experience. 

Also during that time I had the pleasure of watching Mobb Deep record in-studio at 8 Mile records, going on the road with our producers to grab voice over for dialogue for the game wherever and however we could including hiring a mobile recording studio and finally I got to Executive produce a television show about the video game for Spike TV, which for me was a cool career milestone. 

BET’s Backyard Barbecue at 50's house in Connecticut featuring music from 50 Cent, Eminem, Dre and G-Unit and other favorites of 50s was a blast to help support and make sure we got the game in front of fans of 50s because he wanted that game to be for them more than anyone else.  

This was also the first time I've gotten death threats working in games. I have a complicated relationship with Gamers as a community. I am a gamer because I love games and play many of them but what I've learned over the years is that some people see games as exclusive to their needs and their likes and their wants and forget that this is an artistic expression of a group of developers. So when we launched games that were non-traditional like 50 Cent bulletproof which was more like a complete box set of 50 Cent’s music, videos and songs than a game that could compete with Call of Duty, that's when I got death threats and had to work with the FBI in order to track them down. I don't know whatever became of that. 

50 Cent bulletproof was not a very well executed game but it was a well executed product. It had all of his music and music videos, and it created a world written by Terrence Winter, one of the writers from Sopranos, that allowed 50 to become a character inspired by his music persona but someone completely different and it was a big success despite low review scores. The follow-up game 50 Cent:Blood In The Sand was a much better game with much bigger premise and should have been an action movie. 

I was also super proud that year because Universal made a big pivot into original games and that year took a big risk on a game called Prototype. Prototype was an incredibly cool game that leveraged a very unique locomotion system with an incredible story. Ultimately that game was published by Activision after the merger but I'm super proud of the work that we did getting a cover story in Game Informer (RIP) was a huge moment for us as.

TimeShift from Saber Interactive had been a long beleaguered PC game shuffled between a couple of other publishers/distributors, but then came to Universal as a console game. Saber did a lot of hard work to revamp the concept but keep the core gameplay intact which made it one of the most innovative Shooters of that year.  That was the first time that I've been threatened by a developer that he'd get me fired as we were having trouble securing his expected review scores in a year where Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, Halo 3, Crysis, BioShock and The Orange Box had come out. All making that year a banner year for shooters and anything less than amazing was immediately given a seven by most critics. I truly felt bad for the team, but I knew that my job was safe, until it wasn’t - which had nothing to do with him and everything to do with merging two companies together. 

After leaving Vivendi I started consulting in music (that’s another Reddit thread), and then landed a supporting role on the Mass Effect 2 PR team. It reminded me of what working on a hit feels like. Meeting the producing team and seeing them all laser-focused on delivering a great game inspired me to eventually join EA later on but after a few other consulting gigs and one more dance with Atari, but this time the Nolan Bushnell Edition.

Atari: The Sequel

So I decided to join the second version of Atari for one reason only and that was to work with Nolan Bushnell, the original founder of Atari.  Atari means something different to every single person that's ever picked up a game and every single person that's ever worked for the brand. 

For me the first time I worked for Atari it was called Infograms, then rebranded to Atari, so it wasn't really Atari anymore. This Atari was different, small, broke but scrappy. It wasn't just about rehashing Retro Gaming which I believe is a very powerful part of the nostalgia genre, it was about reimagining all of the IP that Atari owned and saying what if it was made now.

Atari was a good place to experiment but one of my fondest memories was when Nolan would be in the office and he would come into my office specifically and ask my thoughts about the business, about the video games industry in general and about how people interacted with technology. He made you feel as if you were insightful and intelligent even when maybe your ideas were pretty insubstantial. He goes in my list of true people in this industry who you can call a Visionary because he saw opportunities when nobody else saw them. 

If you go on LinkedIn you see every single Tech bro calling themselves a visionary and they are probably the “fake it before you make it” kind of people. True Visionaries are the ones that are the weirdos, the daydreamers, the C students and the dropouts who see a better way to do something, a third path that no one believes is claimable or just a single need that's not being met. Nolan is a visionary and it was powerful to be in that presence from time to time. 

I have been blessed to work with other true Visionaries like Mr Miyamoto from Nintendo, Will Wright from EA, Warren Specter and 50 Cent are visionaries.  Everybody else that's ever been successful in games are just really good at what they do. 

While at Atari I got to work on another huge franchise called The Witcher with CD Projeckt Red. It was really cool to see how a smaller studio (at that time) worked with Publishers to publish their IP and how a struggling publisher like Atari could still offer value to a developer as brilliant as CD Projeckt Red. I also got my first taste of working on an MMO more directly with Star Trek Online and a semi-mmo in Test Drive Unlimited.

My Life as a Sim with EA

I won't lie, it felt really good being back at a major publisher again after my stint with Atari. EA was firing on all cylinders and I was given the communications lead for The Sims division which included all of the Sims 3 expansions, the upcoming Sims 4 SimCity the Harry Potter series and a few things here and there outside of the realm of core games. I inherited and hired some of the best people to launch those games. People who could handle the upcoming storms and not get star-struck by famous people.

Katy Perry was an absolute delight to work with and really brought a lot of great ideas to The Sims with her expansion. I got a chance to spend some time with Katy in the studio recording b-roll (PR video), recording simlish and getting her to answer questions for press releases, FAQs and other promotional outreach. When you're in the presence of a superstar, someone that is globally known you have to remember that they meet so many people in passing who are important, who are working for them directly, indirectly and tangentially. So you can't take it personally when they don't remember you. Katy always seemed to remember our team. I think she made what could be a very Hollywood crossover feel more personal, more authentic just by being herself and being a cool person. She even included her cat Kitty Purry in our game.

Will Wright is a true original. He, like Nolan Bushnell could see the world of Gaming not through the lens of trends but through the sandbox of creativity and intention and innovation. I loved working on the Sims with the Sims team and I loved working on SimCity but the But having the opportunity to talk to a Visionary who truly saw Life as a simulation even down to the molecular level who lived life boldly and threw his Passions in racing and science and Robotics was eye-opening to me on a personal level. will didn't have a job obviously he had done well but what lesson I could draw the most direct route to was that he made choices about what he wanted to work on and never let Anyone dictate to him what the next project was going to be even if it seemed uncommercial or impossible.

Since its an election year I’ll also mention that EA funded a non-profit EDU tech team focused on helping school systems use games to engage students and we threw one hell of a non-partisan 2nd Inauguration Ball for President Obama featuring John Legend, Pharrell Williams and their celeb friends. It was a banger.

The hardest time for me at EA was when we launched SimCity In 2013. It was destined to be the rebirth of the franchise by connecting player cities to each other and creating an opportunity for the world of players to see how choices in one city would affect the other. It was a powerful metaphor for living on this planet together.

Will had already left the studio by this point but would drop in and see how things we’re doing and we formed a little bond. 

The studio at that time was being helmed by very capable people but one of the challenges that the team faced was it had never launched a server-based multiplayer game before. So upon launch it was instantly crashed by the huge numbers of people who wanted to play the game. The team frantically worked 24 hours a day to stand up more server shards and get more players in and one problem led to another and another and another and it was a quite difficult time for everyone from QA to the c-suite. EA being quite corporately run didn't want to externally talk about the problems. 

They wanted a basic message that said “sorry we're working on it.” I fought this all the way to the C-Suite because if I had spent $59.95 or whatever it cost back then and the game didn't work on day one I would be quite upset and believe me we heard it from every single player. That was a really tough time for everyone, especially the Developers who couldn't anticipate how the service might topple over or how security functionality prevented sign-ons or how taxing the interoperability of cities and the size of cities would be on servers. So we put our heads together and we created one of the most meaningful mea culpas in the games industry I've ever seen. We said we need time to fix the game, so we're going to give you a free game to play until then. Now you might think that's easy because they're all EA games but guess what every game has a license, every game has partners, and every game has royalties that are paid based on sales. So the tiger team of PR people, leadership, sales and of Developers worked endlessly for a month to get the game operable and figure out what games we could give away for free to say that we were sorry for this terrible experience. I'm super proud of this. I forget the exact number but I truly believe it is one of the largest free games giveaways of all time that predates the game subscription services model. I wouldn't be surprised if we gave away more than 1 million games.

To this day I hear that SimCity 2013 servers are still working and players are still playing and it's a great game and it always was a great game but what I've learned about development is that once you put code out in the world it creates problems. And like a Rubik's Cube where the colors keep changing, developers have to solve those puzzles while withstanding the slings of arrows of rightfully pissed off players like yourselves.

So in the name of shareholder value 900 people got laid off that year including myself which is foreshadowing for the way that the industry approaches talent overall in comparison to stock price. This experience really made me feel radically betrayed by an industry that I love so much and I wanted my next company to feel different and that made me land at Riot games.

Let’s Riot

Riot Games in 2014 was in its prime, yet was still a place where anyone with a great idea could influence the game. The co-founders were accessible, thoughtful leaders who truly wanted their employees to feel empowered. 

I have two strong memories from Riot, Let's begin with the good:

Riot was my first foray into esports. From the LCS to Worlds, I witnessed the growth of North American influence on the long-standing tradition of Global esports. When I was asked to attend worlds in South Korea, I was stoked and my role was to support the global PR organization as we engaged sports and gaming journalists to bring them to our Super Bowl - “Worlds”. I think there were 30,000 attendees for that year’s Worlds, maybe more but regardless, seeing tens of thousands of people cheer 10 people on a stage playing a game radically changed my mind about the collective meaning of Gaming. 

Games transcend borders.  We all know this in this sub because we all play with people from all around the world and it's only when you get into voice comms that you actually understand that you are different. When you're in a Discord or other communities we all speak the same language. We all have the same lexicon of community slang that proves you belong - its inclusive and exclusive simultaneously. 

That year we invited Imagine Dragons to be our closing act and perform their hit songs. I don't think we expected the fans in attendance to react like normal concert goers and rush the stage but they did so rioters had to step in and play security. This is a perfect metaphor for what it's like to work at Riot Games. It was none of our responsibilities to play security. It was not in our job descriptions to play security, but when a Rioter sees an obvious problem we solve it.  The security that we did hire for the event which should have been more than adequate for any other esports event was just inundated by the sheer fan rush for Imagine Dragons, so a few dozen of us formed a human line and just maintained control while the band played. I felt a huge sense of community that day because not only were we celebrating incredible League of Legends competitors but now we were celebrating great music and standing there arm and arm with my fellow Rioters. There was a moment of collective joy we experienced as we all sang along.

There’s no good segue for a dumpster fire…

Now the most challenging time I've ever had Riot Games was when we started a developer newsletter that was designed to articulate and provide context for the choices we were prioritizing for development. During those days we were inundated constantly with questions about replays, balancing, modes and thoughts about the game client. We decided to put together a monthly newsletter that offered context straight from the developers in charge of the game systems, their priorities and goals. What it actually provided was the perfect Bullseye for every player to air their grievances about how the game was constructed, why replays were important and why the game was and will forever be based on Spaghetti code. 

Now this newsletter was approved throughout the organization but because I wrote it,  I took this heavily on the chin and deservedly so. The players were unhappy not because they weren't getting the things that they wanted. The medium of a newsletter was a poor choice, it felt parental and formal considering the devs could be less formal in the forums.  That one newsletter generated so much hate on the sub.

I was embarrassed I had always worked at organizations where we were the middleman and the Developers didn't want to be bothered with that level of conversation. Riot Games was different because they wanted to be closer to the players even if it was just breadcrumbs of context and so even if they made hard choices which ultimately got reversed (replays did happen) and the messenger deserved to be shot.

So what am I up to today?

After Riot I decided to lean heavily into entrepreneurialism. I worked for founders who had done well, raised money and made services that supported games communities and fans. I enjoyed the startup life but I missed being part of a games team.

When Fate Meets Opportunity You Get Unyverse

I'd move back to Charleston after covid because I firmly believed that I could freelance from anywhere and my parents were getting older so I wanted to be closer to them. I was out late one night and got into an Uber and immediately the driver, a self-taught unreal developer began pitching me a video game not knowing that I had 25 years in the field. 

The game concept is simple: An Afrofuturistic RPG with fighting game melee mechanics and Souls-like difficulty that draws influence from many African cultures and projects lightyears in the future in a galaxy far far away. I loved it and offered my help and gave him my card. He never called. Three months later, I got into another Uber and it was the same driver. I leaned over the seat and said, “How’s your game coming along?” He was like, who the heck are you? Then he recognized me and the whole ride home we talked about sci fi, anime, games and film. Three years later we decided to co-found Afrime Studios and are a team of 15 people in 4 countries building Unyverse ([\~www.unyverses.com\~](http://www.unyverses.com/)). We just debuted our prototype at Dream Con in Austin. I’m doing so much more than PR for this company because in a studio our size you have to chip in where it’s useful. From game design, to marketing to business operations and fund raising (looking for angels btw), my day is as varied and as wild as the last 25 years.

I'm thankful for that and thankful that I’m not affected by the consolidation happening in the industry and layoffs. My heart goes out to all my friends who are running out of severance money right now. I’ve been there.

I love the games industry and the many lives I’ve lived through it. I’ve been blessed, cursed, leveled up and overcome some major life bosses along the way, but what I’m most thankful for are the games that people spend years to make, the players i encounter in game who brighten my day or shit on my KDA, and the fact that I’ve bared witness to the rise of the industry that’s going to define storytelling for the next 100 years.

If you have questions about any of this, i'll hop into the comments as much as possible.

Thanks for letting me ramble and GLHF!",8,16,1723662486.0
Call me a Legend,"The Last of Us Remastered, Yes or No?","I'm looking for an honest opinion here. I'm really an FPS fan (Destiny, Halo, Apex Legends, Call of Duty), with a little RPG mixed in (Zelda, HZD, Assassins' Creed, Ghost of Tushima). Didn't like Uncharted, though I only tried the first). I also don't *love* horror games. By that I mean they scare the bejesus out of me.

That being said, do you guys think that I should buy The Last of Us Remastered (ignore the fact that its cheap and I could just buy it and return it if I don't like it)? 

&#x200B;

P.S. I know there are TLOU fanatics out there, but again, I'm looking for an honest opinion.",2,11,1617750209.0
Call me a Legend,Let me tell you exactly why you should be punished for talking shit in an online video game.,"There has always been a handfull of people who greatly oppose the fact that developers tend to punish people who talk shit in online games. Usually these people are part of the older generation of gamers. Richard Lewis often talks about how stupid it is and also Videogamedunkey talked about it in his video where he announced that he was done with League of Legends.

Dont get me wrong. I understand what these guys are saying and on some level its very hard to disagree. If you have had a stressfull day and you come home and just want to relax with some games, and some idiot is just intentionally ruining your experience by feeding or whatever the deffinition of intentionally ruining the game is on whatever game you decide to play, is it really fair for you to get punished if you call him an idiot? Maybe not. But thats not how most toxic behavior in online video games work.

Let me use League of Legends as a reference since its one of the few games ive tried taking seriously and its also a game where I have quit playing it all togheter because of people being toxic. First of all let me just get this out of the way. I am not a snowflake. I have been on the internet for too long to care if some random kid calls me an idiot because I made a mistake in a video game. And in cases where the rage gets really bad I dont have a problem just muting them and moving on. The problem I have is that in 90% of the cases it doesnt just end there.

When people rage in a video game like League of Legends, they effectively stop playing the game all togheter. They are basically just inting and even if I mute them I still have to watch their characther go still every minute or so and I know that he is typing some shit in the chat instead of playing the game. His/her entire focus is now on their teammates and critiquing the way they play instead of focusing on defeating the enemies. And thats why I am in favour of punishing shit talking in video games, because its not just about shit talking, its about the fact that these people are almost literally removing themselfs from the game because they are too focused on typing worthless shit in the chat. It is incredibly frustrating to start a game of League and seeing someone start raging early on in the game, because you know he is just going to continiue throughout the entire game and most of the time the game is just over at that point.

So for anyone out there who still believes that being banned for shit talking in an online game is stupid, please take a look at the games you play, I mean really look at the effect shit talking has on the game and how much it reduces your chance of winning. It is incredibly comon to lose because of toxic behavior.

You could argue that calling someone who intentionally loses a game an idiot isnt the same as some guy who rages for an entire 20 minute long game and you would be right in doing so, imo. But it is incredibly difficult to make a system in a game with millions of players, a game that has thousands of reports every day, that can tell the difference. It is way easier to just draw a line and say ""we punish all acts of toxic behavior"" instead of ""we punish SOME acts of toxic behaviors but heres an endless list of exceptions"".

Anyways thats just my 2 cents. Been wanting to vent on this for a while because even though I understand what some of these people are saying, I also think they have an incredibly naive view of how toxic behavior works in video games. Feel free to tell me how wrong I am.

TL:DR My problem with shit talking is not the fact that they say bad words or calling people names, its that most of the time the player shit talking has essentially stopped playing the game because they are too busy talking shit and not caring about the game and you are going to lose because one player isnt participating anymore.",0,21,1550566770.0
Call me a Legend,Disappointed Opinion: BoTW the worst modern zelda,"Disclaimer: I have played every Zelda through since the original and it is my favorite game series

BoTW has been a huge disappointment to me, but I feel like I am alone in my sentiment. This game is not fun, it is not like any other zelda game and should have been called Legend of Farcry, or A link to Assasins Creed.

The world is filled with uninteresting tedium and is Zelda in characters only. Gone are most of the interesting dungeons
Gone is the buildup to the final fight.

There is no longer any magic of finding a new item and running around the world looking for ways to use it and unlock heart pieces.
We get everything within a few minutes of starting the game.

Remember the feeling of finally getting a bow or the hookshot? That is nonexistant in BoTW. Remember playing a LoZ for the first time and seeing a wall you can blow up but you hadnt unlocked bombs yet?

There is no magic in this game, its a tedius weapons management simulator.",11,43,1489767739.0

Ok, basically I'm working on a monster taming story, and you should see already where I""m going. Thing is, I'd try to put in things like your monster (mine are called Crystures, Crystal Creatures) being able to actually move around the battlefield to jump, dodge, throw things, or grab your opponent. Instead of 9 places to go to, it'd just 7. This is because my 'typings' (they're called Domains here) are grouped into groups of 3, 18 total. (Again, not wholly trying to copy Pokemon, just OCD not wanting it to be 17 or 19 since those are prime numbers) Infernal, Oceanic, and Terra form the Elemental Family. Cure, Decay, and Conflict form the Cycle Family. Artificial, Skyward, and Natural form the Planetary Family. Music, Dream, and Emotion form the Mind Family. Monster, Veil, Mystical form the Supernatural Family. And Astral, Nihilistic, and Meta form the Legend Family (that should explain what kind of Crystures are in there). You can craft armor for them, and there'd be a lot more clothing options for your Handler. Like be able to wear 10 rings, since, you know, you have TEN fingers rahter than just 1 or 2. For battles, your character actually would have HP, since Crysture battles can get pretty explosive, obviously. You'd insta-lose if it hit zero, clearly.",2,11,1638580550.0
Call me a Legend,What makes a game an RPG?,"Ok so this has bugged me for a long time but an intelligent discussion could be fun, when is calling a video game an RPG wrong? Let me explain, for one by true definition pretty much all video games (at least modern) are technically rpgs but when do we laugh when someone calls a game an rpg, or when does an action-rpg lean to much on action and stop being an rpg. It's a long debate I tend to get into, is Skyrim an rpg what about Zelda no but what about Diablo or the Souls series yes but how are those different then skyrim or Zelda, and it goes on in different ways but it's finally brought me to how should we truly call these.  So yes to me games like Skyrim and Legend of Zelda do not count as rpgs even though they are labeled as such but are just action games with mild rpg elements where as games like the Souls series and Diablo are rpgs to me due to heavy reliance on old rpg standards with a few action elements but this is just one man's opinion. So how do we lable these and others just off what the publisher/developers say they are or do we need to dig deeper?",0,20,1506962101.0

Call me a Legend,"I know it’s not really trending anymore, but I just wanted to thank Insomniac for a fantastic game.","I’m older (early 40s) and have a long history with casual gaming. I’ve never done it seriously, (adulthood can be such a pain in the ass), but can say throughout my life, there have been significant periods dedicated to memorable games. It started with Dungeons & Dragons on Activision, The Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Bros on Nintendo, Golden Eye on N64, and the game that I thought would wreck any hopes of achieving adult status - The Legend of Zelda - Ocarina of Time.  Fast forward from this through my ‘experimental’ years to PlayStation and a lot of Final Fantasy, Call Of Duty, and God of War. 

I thought modern gaming was lost to me, because it seemed as though I wouldn’t survive in a world where I had a lot of online friends to play with, because I have zero...

I let Witcher 3 and Fallout 4 consume me for a long time, but was again seriously dismayed coming out from that to find most of what people were playing was MMO.  I’m not opposed to MMO, I just don’t even know how to start the process of finding people to play with online!

Then Spider-Man came along. In my 35 years of casual gaming, I’ve never played anything this fun!  It is the only game (in modern times with DLC and trophies and such) that I’ve played to 100% completion (Main story and DLC, haven’t done the New Game +) and collected all trophies. I’m bona fide sad today to turn it off. 

PSN has a huge sale going on and I’m downloading RDR2, Bloodborne, and Horizon Zero Dawn because they’re cheap right now, but I’m already missing swinging through NYC, and hearing the bad guys say, “He’s taking out too many of us!”.  

Thanks Insomniac for making a kick ass game that I didn’t have to deal with micro-transactions or parties to join. It was a pure pleasure to immerse myself into the world you envisioned from the creators who came before.",11,10,1560561961.0

For me when I see games like hyperscape and apex legends I always wonder what it would be like to have a gamemode besides BR. In my honest opinion  I feel like hyperscape could've been the game lawbreakers tried to be. Same thing with amazon's new game called crucible. Like why make a battle royale when you can try anything new something competitive and inherently balanced. These hero/character concepts are really cool but sheesh.

Call me a Legend,I Don't Want My Favourite Franchises To Release New Games,"I don't know whether I'm getting older or that the world we live has gotten so shit it's seeped more into modern gaming but it's has become such a punch the gut since the xbox 360/PS3/ Wii era.

I loving gaming been doing it since the N64 and since then I've grown fond of certain games and just keep seeing the disappointment with new releases. It's finally hit me the other day, I don't want them to release any more games. My reasonings is 

Timesplitters 
Timesplitters future perfect had it all, charm, humour and character. Let alone the amazing campaign, the bonus modes and the sheer volume of characters you unlock by beating the game / challenges. Modern gaming would murder this concept and again be left with a half baked game with a hand full of modes awaiting a ""road map"" to get all the cut back content out. 

Skate 
I loved the orginal skate all the up to 3, sure they aren't perfect but you had a more or less completed game. The new skate by EA will be a free to play shit show of mostly locked content probably parks, skaters, missing features and a massive fuck off store to buy all the cosmetics you want that was in the previous games. 

Any new halo 
Halo 4/5/infinite - the general lack of direction, the story to enemies to any kind of flow that made the bungie games so well loved, also side note why was infinite it free to play, who asked for it?  I can't be a certain colour spartan without fucking paying for it because they need to get some money back for a free to play game... Makes no sense. 

Battlefield 2042.... I don't even need to go on after that game but christ it was bad, 2 hours of free trail delete kinda bad. I would kill for a good bad company 3, but it won't be like bad company 2. It'll be a awful knockoff battle Royal gimmick, filled mirco transaction shit and half the content and improvements of the last few decades ignored for a game that'd be abondoned after a year or so of support. 

Titanfall 3, after the money grabbing, cheating and overall half arsery that is apex legends. That and the lack of interest from devs to only now fix the titanfall 2 servers, just shows they don't care about what state their game is in as long as the money rolls in. 

Call of duty.... Well I don't even need to continue with this one.

Im so tired of this free to play, road map, season pass bullshit. If you want my money to complete the game I will pay it. I never asked halo to be stripped to bone for it to be free. I wouldn't care, allow me to enjoy the franchises I love without feeling sad and annoyed by how such giants of my childhood, teens and adult life are just barely living husks being whored out and puppeted along by the greed to bleed every last penny out of people's wallets. 

I still do enjoy gaming there are developers who can release good games that keep some of my favourite franchises going, god of war for example and some great indie games and new IPs. I just wish that games with proven track records, can have the love and attention they need instead of using their name for the sake of nostalgia and a needless cash grab.

I'd also like to state I haven't pre ordered a game since OG MW2 and have never spent a penny of a free to play game, so Im not funding the shitshow, water pistol against the sun but I stand by it. 

Anyone else think like this? Or am I on my own with this?",0,28,1699909341.0

Call me a Legend,Looking for suggestions on some coop with my buddy who doesnt play much.,Me and my buddy mostly play apex legends and recently call of duty. I play video games constantly but him not so much. I have been looking at Tom Clancy's Breakpoint. it has super mixed reviews. can anyone shed some light or give other suggestions. Just looking for a badass loot and shoot.,0,3,1584874872.0
Call me a Legend,[Suggestion] Games without much story,"I cannot play a game for long with a concrete story. For example, I have tried playing Metro last light I only got 2 hours in and I gave up. These kinds of games can't hold my attention for that long. I enjoyed playing Call of Duty Multiplayer, Minecraft, Terraria, TF2, League of Legends. I believe that it's the story that turns me off.

Call me a Legend,Help with co op play,"Hello, I wanted help with games that I could play with my son. We have a Playstation 4, a switch and a PC. I want to play games with him where we can team up and shoot things or shoot each other and stuff like that. He likes games like Apex legends and call of duty and wants to play with me.

We don't have two ps4s or two switches . So cross play would be needed. Thank you!",1,4,1589742925.0
Call me a Legend,RESPAWN Entertainment might take over in the future...,"Its early to call it, I know. But if I had to mkae an investment now to a gaming company, it would be respawn. I think they are completely overlooked because consumers took the COD side when Titanfall was competing with them. Unfortunate, since I also think that Titanfall 2 is THE best FPS released PERIOD, still to this day. 

&#x200B;

Now Apex Legends is out and everyone loves it. Respawn is getting the attention they heavily deserve and I hope they continue doing what they are doing. I really want to see Respawn win at the end of all this and will be supporting them. They just seem like they really do have the gamers at heart (reminding me of CDPR), so how can you not support?

 I tried Apex last night and I suck (getting a mic today,) so I will see you all on the battleground (pun intended) tonight while I get my practice on. If you would like to assist me to ""Git Gud"" then add my GT Xv PROPHETE vX

Call me a Legend,PC game giveaway!,"So I've been going through all my old things after I graduated college and came back home. I've been needing to get rid of stuff for awhile now, but instead of throwing out my old PC games, I've decided to give them away. They're just collecting dust in my closet, and I would rather see them getting used by somebody.

Here is how it is going to work: Respond directly to the post stating 1. The game you would like. 2. Why you want it. 

I will be choosing who receives each game based on your reasoning behind it. Maybe it was an old game you never got a chance to play, maybe it was your favorite game as a kid and you lost the disks, who knows. 

Some info about the games: All the games that require CD keys will come with them, however, these keys have been used before so no guarantees. I'm pretty sure you would be fine, since I'm obviously not going to be playing them, and I never registered games that asked me to anyway.

About the giveaway: The games will be free. Although, I just lost my job so I have plenty of time to send the games but if you win, I'm going to need a couple bucks for shipping. Probably just like $3-$4 max for the bigger ones. For the smaller ones that just have cds I'll take care of it.  Also, winners will be decided either tonight or tomorrow morning, whenever I get back to this. I'll edit it when I'm done taking submissions.

So, you're probably wanting me to shut the fuck up and tell you what the games are. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/K2Wxh.jpg) is an image of them to prove I actually have them, and here is a list because that picture sucks:

1. You Don't Know Jack
2. The Sum of All Fears
3. Total Immersion Racing

5. GTR Racing

EDIT: I haven't disappeared. Going to decide winners tomorrow morning sometime. Keep them coming.

EDIT 2: Alright! Going to be picking through the winners here shortly. **Note:** Any requests for games that have already been requested after this point will no longer be considered, **however** the first person to request a game that has not been picked will probably get it.

Call me a Legend,My Gaming Expenses for the Last 8 years.,"I saw some people on the internet arguing about PC vs Consoles and which was cheaper in the long run, and it got me wondering about my gaming expenses for the past generation or 8 years (which is also how long I have been married).
A couple of things to keep in mind with this list is that I frequently got games in bundles, from Buy # Get # Free deals and other promotions, as gifts/contest prizes, and through trading games, so if a price seems unbelievable it is probably because I am spreading the cost among various titles. This list contains games I have RECEIVED as gifts, but not games I have given. The list also excludes games I have borrowed or rented, which has only been a handful (on every platform).

Also, every console, PC, and handheld includes all the peripherals which were used with it (including TV and monitor), even if it was already counted with something else (e.g. Wii remotes were bought for the Wii, but also used with the Wii U, so their cost is included with both consoles). It should be noted that my first 360 stopped working right after warranty expired, so I got a new one.

Keep in mind that I did not always get the best deals I could have on any of the platforms (I’ve gotten a little smarter as time has gone on).

Realm of the Mad God,Help save one of the best games I've ever played: Realm of the Mad God.,"Browser games hold a dear place in all of our hearts, whether it's Club Penguin or Runescape; many of you however, wouldn't have heard of [Realm of the Mad God](http://www.realmofthemadgod.com/). *see end for some tips*

It's a free to play, massively multiplayer, 8-bit, perma-death, trading simulator, bullet-hell shooter. Sounds like a gimmick, but it's by far the most unique and enjoyable game I've ever played; almost unlimited replayability with hundreds of ways to play.

From cruising as a beginner through the easy parts of the game, to attempting to become the most powerful character without trading (or even speaking).

Incredible highs when you finally get that drop, to devastating lows when your beloved wizard finally takes one too many bullets before you can escape.

Run solo with ease, choose a server with almost no people in it; or join in the 'fame train' and crush gods with hundreds of other players.

One of the greatest communities of any game I've played, with global chat you can start a conversation about anything, with anyone.

[Some gameplay if you're interested, any and all of this is available to any player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pyjHfuYcp0&ab_channel=remm)

Yet despite all its great qualities, the game has fallen on some hard times. 3 years ago the original creators of the game sold it to Kabam, a company known for making social media games, ones which require money to win. Within the first year the game had been monetized quite heavily by the new team; yet after an uproar by the community they were fired and replaced by a seemingly more competent team. However through the years Kabam has pulled them team from the game, and it seems only one person is left actually working on it (and he's a sincere guy).
> For those who are disappointed there are no re-skins, new dungeons etc etc. The reality of the situation is we cannot do those things without significant engineer time. We aren't choosing to ignore the options - we just can't do them. We are making the best out of the available resources we have. -Nullbot, RotMG developer

The game I've loved for so long is dying out; and without almost no life support.
I don't know what Reddit will do; maybe find a company to buy it off Kabam and give it life, or maybe just rekindle the fire and show that the game needs some loving. 

*However don't be fooled into thinking the game is pay to win, it's all just pay to take shortcuts. Within a day you can unlock all the classes and you can EASILY get any loot sold from the shop in game.*

 **You don't need to spend a cent to be a high caliber player**

Whoever you are, pick the game up. Run around and pew pew some things for a few minutes. Don't get upset with your first death, learn from it. I know someone out there will fall in love with it.

(A few notes; you can easily block all spam in the nexus in the options and none of the items in the shop are real-world money only)

EDIT: So many people are downvoting comments for no reason, just because you dislike the game doesn't mean you should downvote someone's opinion.

EDIT 2: HOLY SMOKES, thanks everyone for supporting this. If I sounded like I was complaining about downvotes it was only because every comment in the thread bar 1 were under -10, no matter what they were saying.",1068,296,1435140350.0

Realm of the Mad God,HELP! I need a programmer to prove that the developers of Realm of the mad god are scamming their fans!,"I've been playing a game called realm of the mad for almost a year now. It's free to play but I've already put $30 dollars into the game. About a few months ago, a glitch known as 'duping' became prevalent and easily doable by any player. It allows you to replicate an item in your inventory an infinite amount of times. This glitch has destroyed the game as the whole game economy is based on trading items for other items. I recently convinced myself that this duping glitch was a huge scam by the game devs to make more money on the game. With a surplus of 'rare' items that are normally very difficult to get, almost every player in the game can easily get their hands on the best items. The game developers claim they have been working diligently on fixing the problem, but months in, it is still unsolved. And conveniently, they had a sale on realm gold (credit used to buy game content) which you buy with real money. I am trying to convince people that the problem of duping is a very simple fix for a competent programmer. I'm getting a lot of negative feedback and claims that I'm a hater/crazy skeptic. PLEASE, I need a real programmer to analyze the problem and tell me if I'm right or wrong.

PS: This video gives a description on how to do the dupe. It basically takes advantage of being able to have multiple attempts of connecting at the same time.

Basically, the plot is you have to defeat the minions of Oryx the Mad God and eventually defeat the Mad God yourself, it's an ungodly task that will require you and the other players in that realm to work together to defeat the enemies and get to Oryx's Castle and bring freedom to the Realm.

It also has elements of a bullet hell shooter, it's a very nice game and I truly recommend it for MMORPG/Bullet hell fans.

Realm of the Mad God,Dungeon Crawlers,"Please help. I have struggled in finding a dungeon crawler that fits what I’m looking for. First of all, I God damn hate isometric hack and slash/ turnbased games so fucking much. They are the worst possible games to exist. Or just isometric. 
What I look for in a dungeon game is good enemies, lots of them, good progression, variety of choices, and loot thats worth it, because there is nothing like working through a dungeon and seeing the results. There are only three dungeon crawlers that have come even halfway up to my standards:
-Enter the Gungeon
-Realm Of The Mad God
-and ironically, Minecrafts Hypixel Skyblocks dungeons

Now let me tell you what i like abt them, and then my reason why it still doesn’t come up to my standards for a dungeon crawler. 

Enter the gungeon is a beautiful bullet hell with good bosses, enemies, rooms, and substance. However, it lacks variety and options when it comes to switching weapons and such. And it lacks loot. Which ruins it for me.

Realm of the Mad God is a really cool game, especially the dungeons side. It has great enemies, an absolutely amazing amount of variety when it comes to rooms and different dungeons, and it has a lot of loot, and it’s an awesome example of a bullet hell. However it lacks substance and a point. One you reach max level, which max takes you half an hour, all you can really do is make a new character, or try to max your current one by legit just farming Gods, or getting max loot, which for each class you pretty much only have one or two lines of progression to choose from, which doesn’t leave a lot of variety for progression.

Hypixel Skyblock. To be perfectly honest. Skyblock has dungeons that come closest to what ive been looking for. It has a shit ton of variety, tons of loot, a massive amount of preogression. Your armor and weapons have so much room for upgrades and improvement. Theres tons of enemies, secrets, exploration, great boss fights, and awesome co op features that actually push you to work as a team. However the few things it lacks. One, because it’s a minigame, within a server, within a game, it lacks flexibility. It has limitations, which the devs have pushed farther than any game has ever dared, at least in the vanilla version of the game. On top of that, the only other thing that might make it not worth it, is it’s similar to Ark, in the aspect that.. the grind often isnt worth it. It could takes thousands of hours to reach a theoretically truly maxed account, and often uncludes dozens of hours of mindless farming and repetitive actions of grinding, which some find worth it.

I don’t know, I need opinions, and maybe suggestions, as long as it’s not isometric. Pls.",2,3,1656204984.0

Realm of the Mad God,"Quake is a lasting testament to good design, further elevated by amazing mods","By all accounts I should really dislike Quake. The game is super brown, the enemies are tanky and the weapons feel lacking. Before playing this, I had some experience in so-called boomer shooters, many of which have superior weapons and mechanics, so Quake feels a bit barebones by some standards. And I'm not fan of the music either. Music affects me tremendously, and this droning ambient does really set the oppressive atmosphere. Yet I intensely preferred the beginning of Quake II with  it's rocking soundtrack with great feeling of action with a capital A. In Quake it's more like your lost, which I'm guessing is the mood the creators wanted and succeeded in achieving.

But  in complete: this game rocks instead of droning. Everything is in delicate, almost perfect balance. While playing this I forgot that my weapons feel weak - after all, they work in what they're made to do  without irritation or sloughiness. It never gets boring shooting the incoming mobs of enemies and the Quad Damage effectively turns you into a bloodthirsty maniac that stops everything they were doing just to find enemies to murder with reckless abandon. It's just like the eldritch  power is infusing you with madness it's supposed to, because when you find A QD powerup, you want to abuse it as much as possible because of those slighty-not-enough kick weapons. Genius, in a way.

I  love the tight, small multilayered levels. In these old school shooters my greatest joy is hunting for secrets. And Quake does secrets well. It rarely feels like a secret is unfairly hidden and it feels super  rewarding to learn to look for then and becoming proficient in find them as they're well hidden. And it is much more engaging to look for them as there is no clutter and no significant dead-ends. There is no fallacy of making leading you into a dead-end that has nothing there. There is always something, if a dead end exists. They rarely do. The only disappointment comes from finding a Quad Damage after clearing the mobs. This is the case in the main campaign, as Scourge of Armagon quickly introduces more obscure secrets. The mod level Tears of the False God also succeeds in hiding secrets well while making searching for them enjoyable instead of tedious. No wall humping here.

And while I really like the base Quake, man do those modded levels elevate it into something truly magnificent! The mod Arcane Dimension makes Quake feel complete and necessary. Mechanics like the double jump and passive upgrades add a slight element of metroidvania and it really works, at least in the Tears level. And Arcane Dimensions is just one (albeit huge) mod! It's like the whole premise of Quake's slipgate travel and alien worlds takes life in the real world, where you can find  coordinates of these world and explore them in-game. And since some knowledge of modding - or at least the ability to access and decipher the arcane README.txt's - is required, it's like tapping into esoteric knowledge of the Ancients to reach new realms.

I have almost no nostalgia towards Quake. I didn't really play on PC in  those days when it came out. And looking though the old footage of how Quake looked back in the day, I find it off-putting. I tremendously  prefer high resolutions and the improved models of the remaster/enhanced  2021 version. The small improvements in the models' geometry really bring out the beauty of sweet, crunchy pixels and the weapon models are so much better to look at. All this culminates with a big OLED TV as a monitor and auto HDR enabled for much vivid colors. Now with even more intense brown™. Although I must admit that my view is skewed with the warmer tones of the moderate blue light filter that I keep on at all times.

All in all, Quake is really, really good game that stands the test of time. Especially so considering that Quake was the pioneer in many of the fields it contains. I really recommend Quake as well as Arcane Dimensions and will probably recommend even more mods after traversing those worlds in due  time.",190,63,1706949001.0

Realm of the Mad God,All-time favorite browser game?,"Discussion based forum, All time favorite browser games or super easy to run games?

Heres mine:

[**Dueling Network**](http://www.duelingnetwork.com/): A Yu-Gi-Oh! Online type of game. You can make a deck with any card ever made and duel other people in ranked, advanced, traditional and unlimited, with updated banlists, admins that know the game and everything.

[**Realm of the Mad God**](http://www.realmofthemadgod.com/): A game which is alot like a dungeon dive kinda game. Very very simple to get into but very repetitive with no story. You really just go out, kill monsters, level up, get gear but if you die, you lose all your gear and it's not very story based.

[**Town of Salem**](http://blankmediagames.com/TownOfSalem/): A game where theres roles in a town, and to win, you have to work together, but you don't know anyone elses roles. There can be mafia, towns people, serial killers and more. Easy to get into, but easy to get bored once you played all the roles.

[**Game of Bombs**](https://gameofbombs.com/): Like Bomberman but MMO style.

[**Agar.io**](http://agar.io/): It's like spore kinda where you start off as a tiny cell and you eat other cells to grow bigger. It's very competitive and rage worthy but gets boring quick imo.

[**Littlewargame**](http://littlewargame.com/play/): It's like starcraft kinda but very basic with fantasy medievil elements.

The title basically says it all, but I'm looking for a good game to play while waiting to buy Old Republic in a week. In a nutshell, I'm looking for an RPG game that I can log a ton of hours into on my computer. I've already played through Torchlight, Kingdoms of Amalur, Skyrim, Diablo I & II, World of Warcraft, and the like. Realm of the Mad God I've gotten bored of as well. So, the question is... 

Does anyone have a suggestion for a decent RPG game I log time and hours into? Free MMO or not, I don't care. I'm just waiting to get Old Republic soon and want something to play in the interim while on Spring Break. I apologize if this is a re-post that people are tired of seeing, but perhaps others could benefit from a list of good RPG games. Thank you!",2,9,1332128258.0

Realm of the Mad God,Online Games for Long Distance Couples,"Hi r/gaming! I am looking for suggestions from you on games I can play with my significant other for the couple of months we will be spending apart. She has a windows laptop not built for gaming but still good enough to play games like LoL competitively.

I am looking for suggestions and feedback on some games we could enjoy together while apart! My only criteria are that the games cannot be too demanding on hardware, and be friendly for non-hardcore gamers, and has online!

So far, I have:

* Terraria
* Minecraft
* Starbound
* Portal Knights
* Garry's Mod
* L4D2
* Magicka
* DOTA & LoL
* Mabinogi
* MMOs (WoW & Guild Wars -Thanks u/treemncs !)
* Rocket League (Thanks u/8ack_Sspace !)
* Don't Starve Together
* Borderlands
* 7 Days to Die
* TF2
* Realm of the Mad God
* Portal 2 (Thanks u/El_Keablo !)
* Overwatch (Thanks u/cadencebeats !)
* TableTop Simulator (Thanks u/buttbag_jr !)
* Divinity Series (Thanks u/the_impossible_kid !)

I am concerned that perhaps some of these games won't run on her laptop, but I have my fingers crossed! L4D2 might be too intense, though I'll ask her about it. Mabinogi was a lot of fun back when it was more popular but I heard that the playerbase is almost all gone and I will be decently ahead of her since she has never played. Are there any other fantasy life RPGs I should try out? 

Even if you have no new game to suggest, please leave a comment anyways! Even if it's outside of what I'm looking for, do a favor for couples also looking for online games and mention it anyways! I'll throw it on the list!

Edit: I took off some games I thought of just so when someone suggests it I can read why they would think it's a good match. Added some games suggested below",1,19,1483044781.0

Tips:  

* Don't buy an individual game unless it's in a Daily Deal! If what you want doesn't get discounted any further, you can buy it at the end of the sale.  
* Publisher packs are on sale until the end of the summer sale, so you might wait for those also.  
* You can still get prize tickets after the day is over! Just scroll down [here](http://store.steampowered.com/summersale/prizebooth/) to Previous Days.
* If you plan to make a bunch of purchases throughout the sale, add some money to your Steam wallet once using [this](http://store.steampowered.com/steamaccount/addfunds) link and pay for games from that, so your credit card doesn't get falsely flagged by fraud detection.

The game has its own charm which is really hard to find in similar other games so I was wondering if you guys know any games that give the same feeling and fun as Knights & Merchants.

I already played Cultures, it was nice but not the same.

Knights & Dragons,"All I want is Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands, except it's Dungeons & Dragons. Is this too much to ask?","If you've played Wildlands, you know what I'm talking about. That type of game seems to be ideally suited for adventuring with friends across a vast landscape. Wildlands includes character creation and customization, classes, an open world, and great co-op. The D&D version would have similar foundations, just obviously fantasy based rather than military. You could form a party with your friends or go it solo and traverse the landscape taking on quests from villages and taverns, infiltrating camps, keeps, castles, and dungeons, fighting enemies, disarming traps, gaining loot, and experience. Instead of the vehicles in Wildlands, you would have mounts - horses, griffons, dragons? etc.  I haven't played Dark Alliance, but the reviews are horrid. We did play Diablo for a while, but it's missing the tactical aspects of D&D and is too button mashy.",17,24,1671650997.0

Knights & Dragons,"I averaged 14 ""Best Games of All Time"" lists from the last five years together, and these are the results","# Explanation and methodology

I compiled fourteen different ""best of all time"" lists to create one definitive list. It was originally going to be a top 100 but I ended up having enough data to make a consensus top 200. For each list I gave each game a score based on placement (i.e. one point for 100th place, two points for 99th place, all the way up to 100 points for 1st place). I also gave a certain amount of extra points for simply being on the list--otherwise games that ranked low would get basically no advantage over games that didn't rank at all. The amount differed based on whether the list was a top 50, top 100, top 200, and so on. Making it onto more exclusive lists obviously granted more points. 

# Lists used

I averaged together the following lists, with diverse perspectives and recent publication being a priority in which lists I chose: 

**Media rankings**: Empire (UK, 2023), USA Today (US, 2022), Popular Mechanics (US, 2022), Looper (US, 2022) IGN (international, 2021), Slant magazine (USA, 2020) Game Informer (US, 2018) Games TM (UK, 2018)

**Critic ratings**: Metacritic top 200 Metascores of all time (as of 2023)

**Gamer ratings**: IMDB top 200 user ratings of all time (as of 2023), Ranker top 200 user ratings of all time (as of 2023)

**Critic polls**: British GQ Industry Poll (UK, 2023)

**Gamer polls:** TV Asahi viewer poll (Japan, 2021), Hobby Consolas reader poll (Spain/Latin America, 2021)

Knights & Dragons,Other games in the fashion of Knights & Merchants?,"I discovered this amazing game way back in, I believe 1999 (pretty sure I was playing it right thru y2k...)

https://store.steampowered.com/app/253900/Knights_and_Merchants/

Anyways, I've played it so much these last 20 years that I hunger for more of the same, but different.

I never got into the campaign much, I'd just do the ""practice mode"" that started you off with one laborer, a schoolhouse and some supplies...and I would work on building extremely intricate ""cities"" to try and be as efficient as possible... I was absolutely addicted...and I want more!

Any games out there I'm this fashion that you have personally checked out?  I've done some Google searches and see people recommend games like Starcraft, might & magic, etc... Just to name a few.

Those games are all great in their own right but they do not offer the same gameplay.

K&M you don't really have a central currency that drives all of your various buildings and technology

If I want to hire troops for my army, I have to school them first in the school house, but I need gold to pay them, so I have to build a mine to unlock a gold mine, then train someone to operate the gold mine.

But before I can build the mines, I have to build a woodsman to cut wood and a stone laborer to chisel stone

With the gold mine fully operational I have to worry about feeding my troops...AND my hard working laborers

So I have an Inn where I can stock food, build a farm for grain, and one for wine from a vineyard.  I can use some of the grain to give to the hog farm I built, he will turn hogs into sausage links and lesther and I can give some more grain to my miller who uses it to make flour, and I can take that flour to my baker who makes it into bread

The list goes on and on... I love that.  Games like Starcraft require different mechanics... And don't really layer.

If you've played it you know what I'm talking about and might be able to help me out

If you haven't, I highly recommend getting your butt to steam and buying it today",3,2,1622105802.0

Knights & Dragons,I'll say it how it is..... CAPCOM is the most goated & consistent gaming company.,"Yeah we have had some questionable releases like Devil May Cry 2, but I still find it hard to genuinely dislike any of their output. This more come to my realisation after recently jumping into Dragons Dogma, which ultimately led to, Dragons Dogma 2 being my most hyped game for 2024 so far. RPGs are genuinely hard games to get right to a point where you consistently engaged in all aspects of its gameplay & mechanics but CAPCOM pretty much nailed it. As a whole, what ever platform they tackle they master it & have consistently delivered amazing experiences. They re-defined horror, delivered engaging stories & characters that have resonated with generations of gamers, delivered amazing & engaging worlds to explore, provided some of the most versitile gaming combat & game mechanics, have one of the most incredible game engines that provide some of the most breath taking visuals we see in gaming & have inspired generations of games & gamers.

It’s so cool how your final goal can be seen in the background in certain games!

I’ve only found two games like that so far: Mad Max and Fallout:NV.

Both are open world, yet you can always see your final destination at all times. It’s so FUCKING COOL to see it become bigger the closer you get.

It’s even cooler that by the time you reach it, you are a completely different beast than when you started. That is the most natural feeling journey possible in a video game. Wish more games did that. 

(Eg: I’m NV, I made sure to explore every inch along my path as I slowly went through the intended path. I started as ‘a courier’. By the time I’m at the strip I’m ‘THE courier’. )

This is such a cool way design the world. It really helps the roleplaying element. It always gives you a sense of direction.

Edit:- and ofcourse, I almost forgot, Elden Ring does the same thing. The giant tree is always visible and your ultimate goal. There’s literally no escaping it lol. It’s always in your view, intimidating you while also encouraging your natural curiosity to reach the damn tree. ",1177,190,1715677015.0

Knights & Dragons,"Divinity 2: Dragon Knight Saga or, Arcania: Gothic 4? Xbox 360","Hello, I've been wanting a new RPG for a while now and New Gen doesn't seem to have anything new I particularly want: an open world, fantasy RPG. 
So, I'm curious which is better out of these two and why? 

From what I've seen, they seem very 50/50 in reviews, some people adored them, some people loathed them. So it's rather hard to make an independent judgment, considering there also seems to be a lack of details about the games themselves.

So what're the pros and cons for each? And do they compare to anything? 

(I personally like a striking, open world RPG, with lots of dungeons, armour and weapons variety and decent, unique gameplay (I know you can be a dragon in DDKS, which is rather nifty). 
Story and visuals I can easily forgive, if the gameplay and what not is good.)

Thanks :)!

Yes they are both cheap, but I am but a poor university student, that's eats stale bread with grass stains.

Also a sub note, if anybody could suggest any games for me, I'd greatly appreciate it!
RPG's I like;

The Elder Scrolls franchise (Morrowind the most)
Fallout franchise
Dragons Dogma: Dark Arisen
Dragon Age franchise
The Witcher franchise
Dark Souls franchise (Lords of the Fallen was a no)
Assassin's Creed franchise 
Kingdoms of Amalur 
Fable franchise
Two Worlds 1/2 (kinda anyway, I like the ideas, just not the execution)

Zombie Catchers,My Mobile game recommendations,"Mobile gaming gets a bad rap, usually deservedly so, but here are some diamonds in the garbage.

Looty dungeon: fun, creative little roguelike

Epic battle simulator 2: Mobile TABS

Plague inc: needs no introduction

Smashy road 1 and 2: Basically when you have 5 star wanted in GTA in a car. A ""see how long you can last"" thing, good fun

Happy wheels: Some good fun, excessively gory platformer

Terraria: Just got updated to 1.3, survival crafting 2d boss rush

Block battles: star guardians: Isometric twin stick shooter

Crossing dead: endless runner, but still good

Zombie catchers: You run around harpooning zombies to make them into smoothies and sell in a drive thru. Fun.

Angry birds: needs no introduction

Warhammer 40k: freeblade : On rails shooter, set in Warhammer 40k

Beat street: Side scrolling beat em up

Stardew Valley: Inexplicably good and addicting farming simulator

Smash hit: On rails shooter where you shoot metal balls at glass objects so it doesn't hit you

Poly bridge: Bridge building physics game

Downwell: Classic game ported to mobile. A platformer where you go down a well, stomping on dudes and shooting them with your gun-boots

Tower Fortress: Reverse downwell with boss fights

Mini Dayz: Offline DayZ from a top down perspective, great fun, I get very tense and nervous while playing.

Paper's please: A deep exploration of  border security that makes you think. Play it before you vote for any politician that wants to tighten border restrictions.

Highway: An endless runner where you attempt to go down I-80 while doing sick jumps with your nitro boosters.

Fallout shelter: Most of you will have played this, good base building game

Evil Factory: one of my favourite games across any platform. a boss rush game where you can't attack directly, on place bombs which detonate after a few seconds

Stranger Things: the game: a puzzle game, very, very good

FTL: one of the best rogue likes of all time. You control a space ship, and have to manage crew, power, oxygen, and fires while battling other ships. I am still playing this, all these years later.

Hopefully some of these are enjoyable for you, of these Zombie Catchers, Looty dungeon and block battle are probably the weakest links, but I still recommend them. I tried to avoid all pay to win online games ( that means supercell ), so a small amount of them will have pay to win elements but you won't be punished for not paying because other players can't raid you ( eg Fallout Shelter ).

Zombie Catchers,My Left 4 Dead 3 wishlist,"Hey there everybody! I've had a few ideas for new infected, items, and threats in L4D3 that I've kicked around in my head for a couple of days and wanted to share. Truthfully I doubt anybody important from Valve will ever see this, but it could be a fun design exercise anyways. So without further ado...

**New Special Infected**

**""Shooter""** *(trapper class)*- Looks a bit like a smoker that mutated to have a ridiculously large mouth and very tiny vestigial arms. Highly versatile as both a mid range damage threat and a close up one.

The shooter does what you'd think. It spawns in with about 50% ""ammo"" and can shoot out it's ""bullets"" (which are bits of bone and gore from other zombies/survivors it's eaten) at a slightly faster rate of fire than a tier 1 shotgun. Damage is pretty high at close range, with a harsh fall off the further away you get discouraging using it as a sniper but not completely making sniping useless. It's ""bullets"" aren't subject to friendly fire and simply move through other zombies in the way.

The more ""ammo"" it has the slower it moves, moving at about a boomer's speed at 100% ammo, and about jockey speed at 0% ammo. To refill on ""ammo"" after spawning you use its melee attack on other common and special infected. It's melee attack isn't a claw swipe like your average special infected, instead it lunges its huge mouth forward at melee range, grappling a target into it's mouth and swallowing it whole. You can also do this to a target by falling off a medium distance above it (similar to the jockey). 

When you eat common and other special infected this process is immediate, and if you eat certain units (spitter from L4D2 or the Sticker described below) the ""ammo"" gains special properties based on the target. It can't eat the boomer, charger, witch, or tank. It can't eat an incapacitated survivor on the ground, a crouching hunter, or a jockey walking on the ground. 

However, if it attempts to eat a survivor it begins the pinning struggle. Its damage isn't very high, in fact it should probably be the lowest of all ""trapper"" style special infected, but what happens when it incapacitates a survivor while struggling is what makes it so dangerous. If it incapacitates a survivor that its trying to eat, it begins the process of actually eating the body (which takes about 4 seconds). Once that time has passed, the survivor dies and their body/equipment disappear inside of it and the shooter gains 50% ammo. From that point on there will be no body left behind of that survivor to be resurrected with a defib unit, and no guns, pills, throwables, or health pack slot items left behind. 

As a primary balance point, the shooter can't eat or attempt to eat anything if it's ammo is at 50% or higher, and it's interaction with other trapper zombies is as follows: It can steal from a smoker if the target isn't being dragged on the ground, it can steal from a jockey (and will immediately eat the jockey gaining 25% ammo in the process), it can't steal from the hunter or the charger. In gameplay it's role will be very similar to a hunter focusing on low health targets but it will have the versatility to approach things from a mid range perspective. 

Durability-wise, this thing would rank just below a charger in health. It can be shoved off a survivor but recovers quickly from being shoved depending on how light or heavy it's ammo supply is. At 85%+ ammo capacity this thing can't be shoved at all. 

**""Snatcher"", ""Snapper"", or ""Catcher""** *(trapper class)* -Looks similar to a jockey with exceptionally long arms and legs. Scuttles across the ground like a freaky spider. Makes virtually no noise when not moving. Can move up walls and onto ceilings effortlessly. Made for ambushing and moving survivors short distances. 

For it's melee attack it scratches forward with both arms similar to a hunter. It's special attack though is most comparable to a mouse trap that also launches you. In gameplay this would serve a kind of ""burst"" damage/movement falling between a jockey and a charger. 

After setting up by crouching (which can be done on any surface, vertical or otherwise), this infected will have two choices to pin survivors. Choice 1 is to reach forward about 10 feet, snatch a survivor, and pull them in towards them doing decent grab damage and about smoker pinning damage as they struggle against it. Choice 2 is to leap off the surface they're set up on, crashing into the survivor doing a bit more damage than grab 1 and carry the survivor a short distance away, doing more damage if they hit them into a wall and having the capability to kill them by taking them off an edge, and then sit there with them trapped. 

In both cases this guy is very much like the mousetrap of special infected. In terms of interacting with other special infected, he can't steal from the charger or hunter, but everyone can steal from him. The shooter described above would eat him as they ate the pinned survivor, similar to the jockey. 

This guys will also have the unique ability to choose to release a survivor at it's own discretion. A bad idea if you haven't incapacitated them, but a good idea if you have and want to set up another surprise further on. 

Durability wise, this thing is incredibly fragile, having to rely on stealth to get the job done. That's precisely why just about all of it's damage/effectiveness is up front, it's supposed to be the ""I wish I saw that mousetrap"" of the L4D world. 




**""Sticker"", ""Netter"", or ""Slower""** *(support class)* looks like a boomer that gave up mutating halfway and became a spitter. Gurgles out a sickly red liquid that trails behind it on the ground. 

This special infected falls into the support class with no meaningful way to pin down and incapacitate a survivor. It's melee attack is pretty strong, but it's not quite durable enough to just run up and slash you without repercussions. 

In comparison to the boomer and spitter, which have very long recharge times on their abilities, this one uses an ammo system that recharges at a similar speed but can be used for two effects.

It can shoot out two things (chosen by pressing the reload button to switch between the two), the first thing is a bubble of it's red goop that lands on the ground and spreads out to about a third the size of a spitter's acid pile, that has two effects. The first effect slows all survivors standing inside it by about 30% that scales to 50% the longer they walk through it, and the second effect is a damage amp that increases damage taken by survivors by all sources by those same percentages. The goop has no effect on infected. The second thing it fires out is a concentrated net of goop that can be fired about 30 feet before disappearing, but if it hits a survivor it coats them in that red goop, subjecting them to the full effects of slow and damage amp and causing them to leave a patch of goop behind them as they walk (think like a snail).

The ground-targeted goop uses about 60% charge and the single target goop blast uses about a 25% charge. It takes about the same time as a boomer to charge from 0% to 100%, but can use it's charge to fire off whichever blast fits the situation as it's charging. 

It doesn't leave a goop pile behind when it dies, but it does constantly have a goop pile generated in a small space where it's standing and leaves a trail of goop behind it as it walks at roughly a smoker's speed. 

**A different kind of threat**

**Rogue CEDA security agents/Rogue Military Agents** I wanted to add something in that would be just under a witch level threat, that would really shake up the game flow. Lore wise this kind of follows with some of the sacrifice comic that showed the military wanting to eliminate all carriers of the virus.

These people would spawn in a pair of 2, and would basically be unfriendly survivors to your group. When they're around, 2 more special infected will spawn in per spawn cycle, and these guys would be going around getting attacked by zombies as well as attacking them and you. 

Durability wise, they have about 200 survivor health (taking roughly the same damage from bullets that friendly fire in normal difficulty dishes out) and they are immune to shoving. 

Aggression wise, they spawn in with a medium chance to spawn in a fixed machine gun turret and with an incredibly high (almost 100%) chance of being armed with an M60 machine gun (which you can loot off them) and armed with tasers (described below and lootable) and throwable items (pipe bombs and bile bombs primarily). 

Their primary purpose in an area, if you leave them alone, is to ""sanitize"" everything before leaving the area and despawning. If you leave them to do their work, they'll hone in on items laying about the level and destroy them: pills, guns, molotovs, and even ammo piles aren't safe from their single-minded cleansing spree. After they've cleansed a certain amount of items, or survived long enough without being harassed by survivors, they'll jump over a fence or into an out of bounds area and de spawn. Automatically taking away many items that would spawn forward in that level (leaving the survivor pack relatively starved). 

Tactics wise: Survivors can either try to avoid them completely (like a witch) or engage into a difficult fire fight against them. Bile bombs would be supremely effective against them: drawing a distracting horde to clump around them, and obscuring their sights so they can't shoot back as effectively. Infected AI would be equally drawn to fight them, but at the same time you'd have to worry about the extra special infected running around and might find it worthwhile to get rid of them quickly. They have heavy weaponry and the use of throwables that all become lootable if you defeat them OR if they get taken out by special infected. They can't be shoved by you, but they CAN shove you if you get to close.

Again, to reiterate, these guys are supposed to be a huge threat almost crowding around Witch territory but approached in a very different fashion.


**New Items** 

**Smelling salts** *(pills slot)* A new supplemental item with two uses.The first use is that you can use it on yourself to immediately get back up if you're incapacitated on the ground. The second use is using it on an incapacitated survivor to immediately pull them up. A good item to fill out some of the much lacking self sufficiency of L4D, it could be too powerful but that's hard to gauge. 

**Sticky Spitter acid bomb** *(throwable slot)* A mixed red/green solution of spitter acid and the new sticker infected described above. It sticks on to a target for a short time doing a good amount of damage over time to it while also increasing all damage it takes from other sources. Good against tanks but probably not as good as molotovs. Can also be used against all other infected and the rogue military agents. Can be washed off in water.

**Stun Grendae** *(throwable slot)* Stack-able to 2 carried same typed grenades. An item that explodes and stumbles all infected in an area, dealing 0 damage but blinding them for a duration of about 4 seconds. Best used against the tank, rogue military agents, or the witch. 

**Fragmentation Grenade** *(throwable slot)* Stack-able to 2 carried same typed grenades. Literally a grenade launcher round but as a throwable exploding item. 

**Sticky Rounds** *(healthpack slot)* An ammo box with a biohazard symbol next to a symbol showing a silhouette of the Sticker described above. These bullets slow targets by 2% per hit, stacking up to a 50% slow. With half of that slow as an added damage amp. Godly effective against tanks, witches, and rogue ceda agents and probably the only ammo box you'd actually want to carry around in lieu of a healthpack. 

**Laser sights as a deployable ammobox** *(healthpack slot)* probably another ammo box you'd immediately set up like the incendiary and explosive rounds, a once per survivor use of laser sights added to your guns, because those are fun.

**ROCKET LAUNCHER** *(primary weapon slot)* A rocket launcher with 2 rounds, not refillable at ammo piles. Does extreme damage to the tank, and one shots most enemies. Watch out for friendly fire. For usability purposes, will explode if it hits a surface, but will travel through common infected up to about 4 deep before it explodes on contact with them. 

**Flamethrower** *(primary weapon slot)* A flamethrower with limited ammo similar to the M60. Decent midrange weapon for clearing common really quickly or setting a tank on fire. Debatable usefulness against other special infected. Tons of fun.

**Bayonette** *(weapon enhancement)* improves your shoves with primary weapon to deal a bit of damage. Self-explanatory.

**Taser** *(secondary weapon slot)* A single use weapon that is replaced by a single pistol if you're on the ground. All rogue military agents spawn with this weapon as their secondary slot and drop it if they die without using it. Using it against a target does no damage, but stuns them for about 4 seconds. If you get pinned by an infected, you have the option to use this against them and free yourself(which is why the rogue military agents are so effective at surviving against hostile infected) stunning them in the process. If you're ~~stupid~~ brave enough to use it against a tank, you'll find it works for about a second.


Well if you've read through this far, thank you! I'd love to hear thoughts on any of this below. And if you didn't read any of this here's a **TL;DR**
**3 new special infected, one that fucking eats people. Rogue military assholes that burn all your cool shit in holy fire. Smelling salts and tasers so you don't have to rely on your noob ass team. A goddamn rocket launcher, and some other cool shit.**

Thanks for your time!

DragonVale,Dawnguard vs Dragonborn,"I've seen dozens of people asking ""Is Dawnguard better?"" or ""i only haz $20 shood i get dwngud or drgnbrn?"". So I thought I could try to help clear this up a bit. I'll hopefully list out most things the DLCs provide and compare them so you can make your own decision.


Ok, let's start with Dawnguard. Everyone knows that Dawnguard is focused on the war between the Volkihar Vampires and the recently re-established Dawnguard vampire hunter guild. The quest line is quite good with the missions taking place in some interesting locations but ultimately the story and your overall objective are pretty boring.

The characters in Dawnguard are similar to the ones you see in vanilla Skyrim but rhere are a few new voice actors to add some new feel to the people. Then there's Serana, she is perhaps the most interesting and well-developed character Skyrim and its DLCs have produced. Your conversations with her can be influenced through your opinion. For example, most conversations allow 3 responses for you, one from a hateful stance, one a neutral stance and the final one offers a caring friendly (more than friendly in some cases) mood to project.

The actual guilds themselves offer basically the same quests with the only thing that is different being the motives. You still must find the moth priest, find the Elder scrolls, enter the soul cairn and then storm your enemies castle with your faction. Dawnguard does offer some new areas though. Firstly is the soul cairn which is...well...shit. There are some new enemies there but they're basically purple colored skeletons. However, the soul cairn will gift you the ability to summon the three new enemies, a new friendly dragon who'll teach you a new shout and an epic purpley undead horse which can be summoned any number of times.

The most famous new power in Dawnguard is obviously the vampire lord form. The only to get this permanently is to side with the vampires which means you will have to chooses between all crossbows and vampire lord ability. Vampire lord is fun bout overall not very powerful in real combat but is very useful for slaughtering villagers.

The second area is the forgotten vale which I was really surprised by. It is actually very interesting if your into the lore of Skyrim, particularly the falmer. You actually meet a living snow elf and also kill one. The forgotten vale holds many ancient snow elf pillars and artifacts and also a huge temple with some really good architecture.

There's a few new enemies introduced but most a simply new variants of old one. The new enemies added are frost giants, female falmer, spriggan earth mothers, chaurus hunters, vale deer, vale sabre cats, gargoyles, death hounds and 2 new dragon types. The only interesting new enemy is the chaurus hunter which is alot like a giant flying wasp and they're quite interesting (QI) when you first find them.

The 2 new dragon types are the highest level types you can find, revered and legendary. Perhaps one of the most interesting fights in Skyrim is introduced with these dragons when two of them start attacking you on a frozen lake and they dive in and out the ice making the fight alot more interesting than the normal dragon fights.

Outside the main quests there are barely half a dozen other quests to do (aside from radiant ones for your chosen faction). The other quests aren't that interesting but they do add some longevity to the expansion.

Long-awaited dragonbone weapons which are immensely powerful, more so than daedric and actually make the dragon smithing perk worth something. The weapons are the greatest thing in the world and really aren't badly needed on PC due to the dozens of dragonbone weapons mods out there (and some are honestly better than dawnguard weapons) but console players will fall in love with them. Crossbows are added as well and whilst more powerful than bows they are much slower to reload and bolts are alot less common than arrows. There are a small number of new spells too, mostly summons from the soul cairn but there's also a few new interesting vampire hunting spells as well.

A few new armor pieces are added but most are just recolored variants of dawnguard/vampire armor. One the other hand, ancient falmer armor is perhaps the sexiest armor in Skyrim and it is obtainable through both quest lines along with a sexy new bow that'll either block out the sun of send down sun rays PLUS a shield that absorbs damage then releases it in a similar way to unrelenting force. The new pets and animal followers in Dawnguard are alot better than the vanilla game. Vampires can call upon frost-biting death hounds and gargoyles while the Dawnguard can rely on armored war dogs and armored trolls. 

You get three new interesting shouts; Drain Vitality (Damage health, magicka and stamina), Summon Durnehviir (Calls an undead dragon) and soul tear (Soul trap, damage health and reanimate corpse all in one).



Now Dragonborn.



Dragonborn sends you to the island of Solstheim to fight the first Dragonborn. You'll meet new friends, visit new places, gain the favor of a daedric lord and earn some cool abilities and gear along the way.

The quest line is notoriously short and even on legendary difficulty can be beaten in about 4-6 hours if you take your time. The characters are not as in-depth as Dawnguard but there is considerably more of them in Dragonborn.

Solstheim itself combines the best of the elder scrolls environment. The infamous mushroom houses of Morrowind coupled with the icy peaks of Skyrim. The island is a decent size, a bit smaller than Whiterun hold and there's only 3 noticeable settlements, Raven rock, Skaal village and Tel mithryn (Mushroom town). It's also packed with mines, caves, Dwemer ruins, Nordic tombs, camps, huts, forts and many other places to fight enemies in. Some new enemies have been added, but more on that later.

The quest line also takes you to Apocrypha, realm of Hermaeus Mora, deadric prince of fate, destiny and knowledge. Needless to say you earn some pretty cool knowledge like how not to hurt you followers, get people to fight on your side and lots of cool abilities. Apocrypha has two new types of daedra called Seekers and Lurkers. Seekers being floating tentacles mages and Lurkers being giant tentacle spitting fish freaks.

A decent number of new enemies have been added to Solstheim and Skyrim. These are: Bristlebacks, netches, Ash spawn, ash hoppers, burnt spriggans, dwarven ballistas, hulking draugr, rieklings, werebears, serpentine dragons, jumping spiders and Flame/frost cloaked spiders. Most of these new enemies are completely new but some are simply new variants of old creatures. On an unrelated note: People who get stressed easily should not tackle the new spiders at high difficulty because they are ridiculously powerful and annoying.

A much larger array of weapons and armor are added. 2 new weapon and armor sets are added with 2 other craftable armor sets, numerous unique and powerful armor sets and pieces along with many new weapons with powerful new enchantments.

Dragonborn is also full of side quests. Whilst it's main quest is shorter than Dawnguard's quest, Dragonborn adds over 25 new side quests with many more misc quests that more than triple the amount of quests in Dawnguard. The dungeons are also alot more interesting than Dawnguard or vanilla Skyrim. Each dungeon has it's own defining feature be it challenging puzzles, varying water levels, doors only passable through using energy bursts or dungeons that require gems littered across the island, they're all brilliant.

You can also get 4 new shouts in Dragonborn: Cyclone (Epic tornado), Battle fury (Elemental fury for allies), Bend will (Get dragons, people and creatures to fight on your side) and Dragon aspect (Deal more damage with weapons and shouts, you also glow).

Lastly, Dragon riding... just no.


So ultimately if you can't be bothered to read it all here's the overall verdict.


Longest main quest: Dawnguard
Best final battle: Dragonborn
Best new characters: Dawnguard
Best side quests: Dragonborn
Most interesting alternate realm: Dragonborn
Most interesting new locations: (Tough one) Dragonborn (For mushroom towns and ashlands)
Best new enemies: Dragonborn
Best dungeons: Dragonborn
Most new gear: Dragonborn
Most interesting new gear: Dragonborn
Most new spells and shouts: Dragonborn


Best overall in my opinion: Dragonborn

Ok, so there we go. I still think Dawnguard is good and if you like vampires there's no beating it but in the end Dragonborn offers more content, more quests, more weapons, more armor, more magic, more powers and generally better things IN MY OPINION!

Do you agree? Did this help? Do you disagree? Do you hate me? Why does everyone hate me?

Please give feedback below and feel free to give your opinion.

Gods & Glory,Dungeon Keeper 1 and 2 and The Command & Conquer Series are now on Steam!!!,"Both Dungeon Keeper games on sale for $2.80CAD right now. From what I can read on reviews its the original game running in DOSBox, no DRM, nothing. I remember playing both these games decades ago and loving it but not being able to find anything like it for quite some time. The Overlord series kinda filled that void and then they made a shitty mobile version that was an obvious cash grab and now we have the originals in all their glory! Also, I did not know this but there's apparently been a community keeping the game alive for 2 decades now called Keeper Klan so check that out if anyone is interested.

Gods & Glory,"Indie MMO ""Gods & Heroes: Rome Rising"" 50% off on steam for $15","I've been playing for the past few days and liking it quite a bit, and at this price it is definitely worth it. $15 pays for the free month alone. Heatwave has been really trying to get this game to its full potential, and their latest effort is to expand the community by lowering the price of the game. Although not quite on par with the AAA MMOs, Gods & Heroes does have heart and if you've even thought about playing it now is a great time to join in. Hope to see you online!

Gods & Glory,"I averaged 14 ""Best Games of All Time"" lists from the last five years together, and these are the results","# Explanation and methodology

I compiled fourteen different ""best of all time"" lists to create one definitive list. It was originally going to be a top 100 but I ended up having enough data to make a consensus top 200. For each list I gave each game a score based on placement (i.e. one point for 100th place, two points for 99th place, all the way up to 100 points for 1st place). I also gave a certain amount of extra points for simply being on the list--otherwise games that ranked low would get basically no advantage over games that didn't rank at all. The amount differed based on whether the list was a top 50, top 100, top 200, and so on. Making it onto more exclusive lists obviously granted more points. 

# Lists used

I averaged together the following lists, with diverse perspectives and recent publication being a priority in which lists I chose: 

**Media rankings**: Empire (UK, 2023), USA Today (US, 2022), Popular Mechanics (US, 2022), Looper (US, 2022) IGN (international, 2021), Slant magazine (USA, 2020) Game Informer (US, 2018) Games TM (UK, 2018)

**Critic ratings**: Metacritic top 200 Metascores of all time (as of 2023)

**Gamer ratings**: IMDB top 200 user ratings of all time (as of 2023), Ranker top 200 user ratings of all time (as of 2023)

**Critic polls**: British GQ Industry Poll (UK, 2023)

**Gamer polls:** TV Asahi viewer poll (Japan, 2021), Hobby Consolas reader poll (Spain/Latin America, 2021)

Final Fantasy 16 had a great free demo, showing off the beginning and how flashy and pretty and exciting everything was. 

But gradually it became an absolute slog of dragged out dull side quests, and then padding out the main quests, and making me fight the same waves of the same enemies going back and forth through the same environments. 

Everything in the game feels like it's just designed to be dragged out as long as possible. It's a 40 hour game that should only be 10 hours, it'd be miles better if it were.

I love short & sweet games that are a nonstop blast, pure enjoyment: Uncharted, The Last of Us, Ratchet & Clank, etc.

Gods & Glory,"My Computer finally died so no more Skyrim, to pass the time I've decided to play Oblivion on my xbox one last time with a twist.","I've decided to kill every NPC in the game. I've beaten oblivion several times and pretty much know where everything is and have done probably all of the quests so I have made an orc berserker with the sole intent of finding and murdering every single npc in the game world. Basically I will never visit a shop or do anything normal, just straight out of prison I ambushed an imperial guard patrol for new armor and weapons and began my killing spree. Surprisingly the face generator works great for creating a monster. If there is enough interest I could write a journal of my orc's journey.

edit: oh god so many posts, I'm using a public computer so it's hard to reply to all of these. Basicly since guards respawn I will just kill all the killable named npcs, I will be hoarding ale, mead, etc since most loot is useless to a character who never shops. I'm playing on xbox and it's unmodded so sorry no way to video record, pictures of my TV would be terrible quality so instead I will write a diary for my orc. I'll try to update daily while it is still fun for you guys to read. I'm extracting data from my old comp right now so depending how it all goes I might be back to skyrim if reformat fixes it, either way I will kill a good number of Npcs for the glory of the internets.

edit: edit: As for a description of the pc problem itself. It has been failing to boot on and off for a while so I was making a bootlog and was going to start debugging startup drivers but before I changed anything it decided to just not start. It would turn on (no power issue) but it would not read the HardDrive (i think) because the prompt would stay blank then just go to the default toshiba screen. Now that I got it to boot once to extract data, the Hard Drive has stopped responding during use and it has been reseting a few times randomly. My guesses are bad Hard Drive, bad Mother Board, Bad bootup(software issue) so I am just gona get a copy of anything important then reformat to see if it was a software issue.",534,373,1322753391.0

Gods & Glory,"Imagine... Black & White, the gesture-based god game, ported to the iPad.","The whole ""hand of God"" control scheme would no longer be a metaphor. You would be tickling/slapping your creature, performing miracle gestures and dragging yourself across the land with your actual hand, not just by proxy of a mouse or trackpad. To zoom in/out, use the OS-standard pinch-to-zoom. To change your viewing angle of the world, you could turn the iPad around in your hands, or tilt it, and the built-in accelerometer will interpret and change the display accordingly. 

Make it happen and make a fortune, Lionhead Studios.

**EDIT** (copied from a reply I posted below):  
The reason I mentioned an iPad-specific port is that its features and hardware are standard in *every* iPad, and there is a marketplace already setup specifically for its users: the iTunes App Store. Yes, there are other tablets that have capacitive screens, multi-touch gestures, and accelerometers, but how many have all three? And what percentage of the tablet market do those specific products hold? And even if its user base was significant enough, how does EA Games market - and sell - a game specifically for them?

Like it or not, the iPad has garnered a lot of attention (more than any other tablet), and the iPhone has proven how successful the app store distribution model can be. I think the iPad is a logical platform choice, and a Black & White port could be quite successful.

Also, purely speculation, but I imagine that given the original Black & White was released for Mac, the port to iPad would be fairly easy to do compared to other PC-only games.",0,8,1265013409.0
Gods & Glory,Having major surgery in September - Looking for recovery gaming recommendations!,"In September I’m having back surgery and will be pretty unable to do much of anything for a few months beyond physio and walking. I'll be off work at least a month. I’m sorting out my list of games to play, but I’m thinking a lot about the first couple weeks where I’ll be on some heavy duty pain killers.

I like a lot of JRPGs and RPGs, though I enjoy most other types of games.

What are some games that don’t require major concentration or a deep learning curve? Not necessarily pick-up-and-play. But just games that aren’t going to hurt my brain system-wise or difficulty-wise.

For instance, I was thinking of jumping into the Persona games but just saw that, apparently, the systems that get thrown at you are pretty convoluted early on.

Robbery Bob 2,Has anyone begun to develop motion sickness from first person games as they got older? Is that a thing? ,"I’m 26M. I’ve been gaming since I was maybe 5 or 6 with a GameCube and never have had an issue with motion sickness. I played all the FPS, flick shooters, COD, Bioshock, etc. I even have an ultra wide because I really love the immersion and game at a constant 120 FPS for most things. Crazy erratic movement and screen shake never bothered me.

Although this year, I’ve noticed I’ve begun to develop motion sickness after a 1-2 hour gaming session. I thought it was a fluke, but today after 2 straight hours of Outer Wilds I felt so sick, and once I stepped away for a while I felt fine again. It looks like my suspicions are true, and I’m developing motion sickness. Has anyone else experienced this? Has anyone found a fix? I used to play games like this for 4-5 hours straight without issues.

Edit: I'm gonna try optimizing the settings and sitting a bit further back. Settings like head bob/motion blur/etc. never mattered for my health but perhaps it does now. I do sit fairly close for a 34"" ultrawide as it fills a decent portion of my peripherals. my FOV is set to 100 already so it's definitely almost maxed out. It's nice to know I'm not alone in this! It was quite the heartbreaking discovery today, as this is my greatest pastime.",1619,795,1723435298.0

Robbery Bob 2,Chinese WoW gold farmers pull an amazingly clever recruit-a-friend trick,"I was running around bored in the World of Warcraft today, tired of coding. I saw a guy (lets call him Bob) in the trade channel who said that he was selling this item for 10,000g:

 

http://www.wowhead.com/item=54860

 

This item, in case you don't know, is a passenger flying mount, the only one in the game. The way it is obtained is by recruiting a friend to World of Warcraft, having them buy the full game, and then paying for 2 months of subscription. All in all, this costs about $50. This is not to say that the mount itself costs $50, because ideally your friend was going to play the game anyway, so you essentially get it as a 'signing bonus' to get more people playing the game. It is brilliant marketing by Blizzard.

 

Back to Bob. Bob seemed shady at first, but I participated in his deal because he was promising to deliver the goods before the gold was exchanged, in this way it was impossible for what he was doing to be a scam. The deal worked like this:

 

1) I show Bob that I own at least 10,000g

2) He sends me an email address to be recruited

3) I log into the Recruit-A-Friend service on battle.net and 'recruit' the friend

4) This gives Bob a 10 day free trial, linked to my account

5) Bob then buys the game and prepays for 2 months of WoW, costing about $50

6) I claim my item which is mailed to me in game

7) I then give Bob the 10k gold

 

Now you may realize that this leaves Bob completely open to being scammed. People doing the advertising generally don't do this. Anyone could essentially, without the possibility of punishment, simply not pay Bob after the goods are given. There is no escrow trading service for this type of transaction.

 

Not only is he open to scam, but this is not economically viable to sustain. The cost of gold on the gold selling market is approximately $3 per 1,000, which means that 10k gold is worth about $30. This means he is paying $50 for $30, which also didn't make sense. This had me puzzled, and I wanted to get to the bottom of it. This guy was doing this ALL DAY, I knew of at least 7 people who bought from him, since this deal is extremely good, because there is a surplus of gold in the game at the moment (hence low gold prices, which were about $8 per 1000 during the summer).

 

So I got to thinking, and ended up coming up with my theory, which after much convincing Bob to spill the truth, he confirmed:

 

There are many companies set up in various parts of the world that essentially farm gold, hence the term you may have heard called gold farming. Huge computer labs employ people who are paid pennies an hour to do things in game to make money. This money is then sent to their employers, and the employers package and sell it online. It's a multi million dollar a year industry.

 

With this recruit a friend program, the gold farmers had realized a huge potential for more money. Since gold farming needs to operate on a huge scale to remain profitable, the farmers need hundreds if not thousands of accounts to keep going. These accounts often get banned or suspended due to their shady activities, so needless to say, they sign up for a lot of subscriptions. Bob was employed by one of these companies to do the following:

 

1) Sign up for a new email account on gmail or hotmail

2) Advertise that he was trying to get his friend into the game, and that he was selling a rocket mount for 10k

3) Give the buyer the email address to be recruited

4) Pay for the game with his boss's credit card, and buy the subscription, giving the buyer the reward

5) The buyer claims his reward, then chooses whether or not to uphold his end of the bargain (I did)

 

So the end result is, the gold farmers get 10,000 free gold with every account they were going to sign up for anyways. This cuts their spending from $50 to about $20 for a 2 month account, which is a HUGE savings in the long run. Even if people choose not to pay, they still have the account that they needed to create in the first place, so there is zero loss. Only profits.

 

Clever, clever gold farmers.

Robbery Bob 2,"""Psychonauts 2"" helped me heal from my own trauma.","We hear all the time about video games being bad for mental health, but I think I just had a rare moment when it actually helped. (TL;DR at the bottom)

I was playing the level ""Bob's Bottles,"" where an alcoholic has been ""bottling up"" his most traumatic memories. IRL, I've been bottling up my own feelings with binge eating for years. However, I've never been able to clearly describe them until Psychonauts 2 gave a visual aid to go on: my inferiority complex.

In the game, Bob's worst memories are contained inside giant wine bottles. Raz has to explore each area to help Bob ultimately overcome his trauma. As Raz traversed through the memory worlds, I start reliving my own in a similar manner; as if there was a physical area of my own worst memories. They were a bunch of smaller moments that crippled my self-esteem:

* Kids making fun of my interests, or just for the sake of upsetting me.
* A teacher yelling, ""WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?! WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?!!""
* My child self tearfully trying to explain something to another teacher, and her yelling, ""WELL, YOUR MOM'S WRONG!""
* Being put in a tiny room for crying after being bullied.
* My teen self telling another teacher about the bullies, and hearing, ""Well, I wasn't there, so I can't do anything about it.
* Two incidents where I was punished for saying ""shut up"" to a bully

The worst part was that I blamed myself for much of it. I'm on the autism spectrum, so I struggled a lot with socializing and communication. Still, I was very hard on myself for how awkward I was as a kid, teenager, or even in my 20's! I think, ""Oh God, why did I say/do that?"" or ""No wonder kids were picking on me!"" or even ""If you hadn't said something so stupid, you wouldn't have embarrassed yourself!""

What happened next resembled another Psychonauts 2 level; each time you brought back a piece of Ford Crueller's shattered mind. His younger self from each memory would help talk sense into his broken, current self. Instead of my younger selves, though, I saw the same me, but more positive:

""It wasn't your fault that you were bullied."" ""You're not the loser that those people made you think you were."" ""Don't look at your past as something to be ashamed of, but a sign of how far you've come.""

We then hearkened back to my childhood hero, Walt Disney, and one of his most famous quotes. ""You kept moving forward without even thinking about that motto. You'll always 'keep moving forward.' You've got this."" For once, I wasn't my own worst enemy; I was my own friend.

Much like Bob, my mental world felt cleared at long last. He unleashed his figurative bottles, and threw away the literal ones in the real world. I think it'll be easier to stave off my own food addiction after this.

And it was a video game, of all things, that helped me find that clarity.

TL;DR: ""Psychonauts 2"" inspired me to release my bottled-up feeling stemming from traumatic bullying. I relived my worst memories, but, by the end, I was finally able to advocate for myself instead of being hard on myself. It was like Raz had cleared it up, just like in the real game.",351,55,1690142877.0

Robbery Bob 2,"Don’t you think some of the best games are ones that don’t try to tie into Movies, TV shows ect and just be allowed to do their own storyline in that universe?","Games like SpongeBob Battle For Bikini Bottom, Knights Of The Old Republic 1/2, Silent Hill 2/3 and GTA 4 were some of the best and most memorable games out of their slew of franchise games or movies. I think the reason is that those games are so memorable is because they came out with their own storylines outside of the established  franchise lore they had.

Kotor, for example didn’t try to incorporate a modern Star Wars story like those before it and decided to tell a more metaphysical side of the force not done before in books that even the Star Wars creator saw as “an accurate depiction of the force.
SpongeBob BFBB focused on telling its own depiction of SpongeBob and the gang that it honestly feels like it’s own game instead of a series of levels 
GTA 4 told a deeply focused story on an immigrant in America  and how he has been warped by the American dream/Military vs how he views the world now

Robbery Bob 2,Crime Boss Rockay City is surprisingly fun,"Like almost everybody, I thought Crime Boss was only a knock-off Payday, a quick cash grab before PD3 releases this month. But now that Payday 3 screwed up with their online only requirement, I gave Crime Boss a try and yeah, it's a fun game.

It's one of those solid 7/10 titles and yes, it is a Payday clone, but someone actually sat down there, thought about what they can make different and improve upon Payday (like Bots being able to pick up and deposit loot, being able to draw and holster your gun at will during stealth. Crime Boss has this special something that you can feel, when someone actually cared for their game.

To get to the gist of it, Crime Boss is 1/4 FPS, 1/4 stealth game, 1/4 gang management and 1/4 roguelite with permadeath. The entire story campaign focussses, for better or worse, around the gang turf minigame, that forces you to attack enemy territories and defend your own. To my knowledge, as long as you don't own every area of the city, you can't win the game. And if Baker dies, that's it, the campaign is over and you start anew with the perks you have collected by leveling him up.

The problem is, that those missions are highly repetitive. You either attack and kill a certain number of enemies before a Lieutenant shows up or your defend your area, by killing a ertain number of enemies without a miniboss showing up. Attacking the enemy is also very expensive and can easily cost several tens of thousands of dollars, especially in the more defended areas.

To finance this, you have a random set of robberies each day, like hitting an armored truck, hitting small stores or busting a police raid. Those are small missions, randomly generated and usually quick to get done. There are also proper, story related heists, but those are very rare compared to the RNG robberies.

This is where the stealth aspect comes in, because Crime Boss heavily encitivices it. Unlike Payday, the difficulty increases the more time you spend in each level. On Heat Level 1, you only encounter regular police, on level 2 you have a mix of patrol officers and SWAT, on 3 you only have SWAT with a few special units (Shields, a cop with a stun baton, Bulldozers), on 4 there are more special units. There also may be an automatic failure if you reach Level 5, since Nasara warns you that the police is blocking off the area and that they will notice your van, but I always bailed beforehand.

And the police does pack a punch in this game. They are not hard to deal with, but if you are not careful and are caught out in the open, they will hurt you.

Another mechanic to encourage stealth is that the more your are shooting and killing, the more pressure the police will put on you. SWAT teams will arrive earlier and the police will clear out your turfs, making it free to take by other gangs. And you can't reduce or stop those things from happening.

To get back to the management aspect, you basically decide how to run your crew. You decide if you hire new gang members and who, you buy the weapons and decide who gets what, you decide how many people get into a level, you decide with turf you attack and how many people you want to send, you decide how many new members you add to your turf wars crew and you decide when to sell your ill gotten gains to the black market to make some extra cash.

And it all costs money. Guns cost money, starting a robbery costs money, promoting one of your goons costs money, fencing stolen goods costs money, taking your crewmates with you costs money etc. It's not a hardcore simulation, but you constantly have to balance risk vs reward and when you plan badly, for example if you take three of your gold level rated goons with you, you only come back with 3000$ or even lose money,

The other aspect is, that every member of your crew, excluding Baker, can only be used once per day, so if you already used up 22 of your turf war crew and a third area is under attack, too bad, you don't have enough people to defend it.

It can be annoying, but it also has its own charme and gives you a better view into what it means to be a gang boss and that it's more an excell sheath than anything else.

But yeah, the game has its flaws, but I liked it more than I thought, so if you want to an alternative to Payday, Rockay City might be worth a look. And if you are afraid of the roguelite element, I was too.

Robbery Bob 2,Some innovative/cool things I think they could add to GTA 6,"1. I think an “airpod” system that allows you to listen to music on foot would be pretty cool. So you’re not just limited to listening to music in your car.

2. A “hogtie” system similar to RDR2. From the leaked footage last year it looked like you could tie up NPCs during robberies, be a nice touch to the GTA gameplay. Maybe stowing NPCs in the trunk and throwing them in the water or to the gators. Sick shit that would be fun to do.

3. More variety of ways to get around. I know this isn’t necessary for a game titled “Grand theft auto” but it’d be cool to be able to use a skateboard to get around, like in Bully. Or if you find horses on the countryside be able to use them like in RDR2. Imagine doing drive bys with AKs and ARs on a skateboard or a horse.

4. This one isn’t really “innovative” as much as a nostalgic wishlist but more interiors. Now not every single building needs to be enterable or anything, but simple things like restaurants, malls, grocery stores, etc would add a nice sense of immersion, like you’re in a city you can actually explore instead of the city just being a background of empty buildings. But speaking of restaurants…

5. Drive thru. Very minor but I think it’s be cool to be able to use the drive thru and order shit from there in the game on top of ordering shit inside. Idk this one’s small but I think it’s be kinda cool.

6. Being able to somehow connect your Bluetooth to the game and listen to your playlists from your phone in the game. Like an “aux” system, it could be a separate “radio” station.

7. NO SLOW WALKING IN BUILDINGS AND CAMP SITES. This really started with GTA 5 but went fuck-wild with it in RDR2. Why are my movements limited suddenly once I enter certain areas? Hopefully they fix this in 6 but I doubt it. This lack of freedom brings me to my final point.

8. More freedom in missions. Another thing that I believe started with GTA 5. I wanna be able to tackle missions how I want to, like we could in GTA 4 and below. I get they’re going for a specific storytelling structure, but moving 2 steps from a set path shouldn’t FAIL me a mission.


There’s a bunch of shit I’d wanna see but these are the main big ones. What do y’all think?",0,7,1701486873.0

Robbery Bob 2,I know it's cool to be all indy...but are INDY GAMES getting a free pass?,"Saw the pc gamer top 100 list of all time. Was surprised that a game like VVVVVV, although entertaining, NO WAY deserves to be on that list over titles such as 1) Batman Arkham Asylum, 2) Plants vs Zombies, or 3) The Witcher. Hell even puzzle quest deserves more cred than VVVVV.

I think pc gamer trying to be hip to all things indie stuffed the ballot box on their list...trying to get a few quirky indy games on the list for whatever reason. Putting a game like VVVVV over the ones mentioned above is not just a gross oversight....it's robbery.

Robbery Bob 2,As a Norwegian I'd really like to see this as a Payday 2 DLC,"In Norway 5th of April 2004 the biggest robbery in Norwegian history took place.  It was made on a bank in Kongsgata, in the city of Stavanger.

The robbery is commonly known as the ""NOKAS-robbery"" (because the bank was owned by The Norwegian Contact Service; ""NOKAS"") and was performed by 11 men. 
In a timeframe of about 20 minutes they managed to break into the bank by using a sledgehammer and steal ca. 10 million dollars worth of Norwegian Kroner.

In the process one police officer was shot and killed.


I obviously have tremendous respect for the people affected by the actual robbery, and their families. But I think seeing this in Payday 2 at some point would be awesome.

Robbery Bob 2,Character idea ( payday ),"
They’re name: Avon Hask

Code name: the Brit.

Nationality: British ( he sounds like a British Erron Black from MK11 but he talks like Crowley from cod WW2 )

Appearance: The wasteland helmet from killing floor 2 ( but with no spikes and it looks new rather then battle worn ) a black fedora. A black button shits. A black leather trench coat. Black business trousers. Black formal leather gloves. Black business shoes without laces. A red tie. He is also Caucasian (white). His male as well.

Age:24

Bio: ex-Paramedic and ex-British police medic. He was first hired by Bain to clean up the payday gangs mess they left. The first bank the gang ever robed wasn’t owned by the government but instead owned by a crime family called the Kavodski crime family, the reason why the gang never saw the family is because in 2 hours of the Kavodski’s hearing of the robbery they was all dead. Luckily there was no children in that family only a husband a wife and an army of hired guns.  The reason why he came out of the shadows is because Bain died and without Bain he isn’t getting paid so he decided to get more involved with the robberies.

Weapons; A custom HK 416 called “ Hask 416” for his side arm “ Hask Hi Power” a custom Browning Hi Power, the difference been; sharper bullets, a built in bayonet and a 24 round magazine. He also has two lever action shotguns and of course the standard 9mm beretta m9.

Facts: he hates smoking, he’s a pyro maniac, he was a medic for the British armed police response, he joined MI6 at 16 did that for 4 years then armed police response for another 4 years and after that he got hired by Bain, he pronounces his T’s.

Robbery Bob 2,"What gives Nintendo games the right to a Triple AAA price game and console, without the similar experience?","I'm probably going to be downvoted to hell, but I'm ignorant and curious, so I apologize. I'm a huge nintendo fan, but still don't understand why a game like super mario odyssey can be given the same price point, for years, compared to a game like Assassin's Creed Valhalla. It feels like robbery...

I remember playing the SNES and Genesis when I was younger, but really never experienced too much of a lesser experience between the two. I want to say the first time I noticed a difference was during the GameCube era? 

Everytime I ask a purely Nintendo fan this question, I get back an answer that involves games being worth far more than $60 USD anyways, so enjoying a title like Mario or Pokemon is totally worth it whether it be for nostalgia, or the replayability value of it.

However, it's not like Nintendo is broke compared to these game studios. It's not like they're understaffed. What stops them from coming out with a game like Valhalla? If you own a switch, which is relative in price to the Series X, you're stuck playing games that are short and extremely graphically downgraded. 

Skyrim was $60. Doom was $60. All feel like lite versions of the game, compared to their counterparts on the consoles. 

Is it just audience? Kids that mainly don't care about graphics, performance, or large amounts of content? Why are kids always targeted at a higher price?

Thanks in advance. This is a bit of a rant because I have a switch and just felt cheated in a way. I probably shouldn't. I own an Xbox with game pass and that is honestly one of the best deals I have ever gotten in gaming. Wish Nintendo would do something similar. 

I understand the whole nostalgia and replayability factor, but sometimes I feel like I'm playing mobile games on a $600 console

How to Get your Gift History:  http://imgur.com/a/PLfFS#0

So here's the deal. The Steam Summer Sale is always full of goodies, and often we have a lot of the games. However, not all of our friends do, and the world always needs more giving and less taking. I will take the first person on the list and add them to my friends list, and buy them a game.  I ask that that person take the next name on the list and pay it forward. Hopefully we can get a ton of games sold and given away to people, and make more Steam friends in the process. Challenge accepted? 

BTW: I'm vastly amused by the downvotes. ""Let's be generous!"" ""BOOOOOOOOO!"" Sorry, gave me a giggle here. ;)

BTW, my Steam ID is 'Shinino'. I'd love to have friends. Not worried about receiving stuff (although I don't turn it down). This is more about giving, not getting ,and I have a ton of games. :)

Note:  I'm trying to add everyone here to my friends list.  It doesn't mean I'm immediately gifting whatever particular game you're asking for.  If I do gift you, it doesn't mean I'm gifting any particular game (unless it's the only thing on your wish list).   Asking me specifically to gift you something, or complaining about why I'm adding you to my friends list (which you accepted, btw) then not gifting you?  That's a quick way for me to remove you from my Friends list, and a way to ensure that I'm not about to gift you.  I'm not going to call people out in this thread (yet), but I just wanted to get the point across.  The spirit here is that I gifted something to someone, then they gift to someone else, and so on.  Be happy when you get gifted, and gift someone else.  Be generous, not an ass.  Okay?  Okay.  

Carry on!

Robbery Bob 2,Could Sony offer credits to players who already own the free monthly games?,"While I appreciate Sony trying to keep everyone happy with top tier games, the fact of the matter is, I own the games Sony is already giving out so I have nothing to look forward to every month. Just looking at this years lineup, I owned SpongeBob (April), FIFA22 (May), God of War (June), Man of Medan (July), Tony Hawk (August), NFS (September), Injustice 2 (October) and LEGO Harry Potter (November).

It almost feels like I’m being punished for purchasing games and now everyone else is getting something for free that I paid money for. 

Could a possible solution be to give players who already purchased the monthly games a credit towards future purchases or maybe even a free month of PS+ that month ($5 as compared to a $60-70 game purchase)? I think this would go a long way towards helping to ensure that those of us who actively buy games still have something to look forward to every month.

Robbery Bob 2,Why do I prefer Saints Row over GTA?,"1. Saints Row has reoccuring characters. Sometimes, not that much of them. Many die in the series to keep The Boss motivated. Saints Row 2 introduced several new characters, who then became lovable main characters in 3 and 4 instead of side characters.

2. Marketing. Saints Row has been marketing on silly weapons and new ideas since Saints Row 3. It then uses DLC from viral ideas. 3 had TF2 hats, IV had ""Hey Ash, Whatcha playin"" homies, and that's just the surface. GTA, however, uses Fox news. Piss off parents with new trailer! Fox news then creates 32 rumors that end up making people buy it.

3. Real songs on radio in Saints Row. GTA has parody songs, if I recall correctly.

4. Better Saints Row controls (San Andreas is a nightmare!)

5. Better developers. Many of the developers at Volition lead the SR modding community. They have their own website for it, too. They have also been looking for ways to work around their unfixable broken character sharing server. Rockstar, however, refuses to fix bugs, has been doing markups during the sale (they were caught by Valve within the hour. Valve removed it. Rockstar responds with a useless pack of shark cards and shit. They also delayed a port of the game for TWO YEARS! It still has bowel loads of bugs they REFUSE to fix.

Maybe I can compare it to using bank robbery money to buy expensive shit from scam dealers and then selling them on the black market and using grenade launchers to destroy the Ronin chasing you.

Robbery Bob 2,I expect Bob Chipman's next Big Picture episode to discuss the mid-credits scene in the Sonic movie,"Now, I follow Bob Chipman a lot because he's pretty funny while at the same time intelligent and critical.  It's just that when I saw his Escape to the Movies review of the Sonic movie, which he gave a 2/10, BTW, I felt it had less to do with the movie itself, and more to do with Bob's bias against the original 2D Sonic games for the Genesis and SEGA CD, and how he spread that bias into everything else with the Sonic brand on it, regardless if it's bad like Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic '06, and Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric, or even good like the Sonic Advance trilogy, Sonic Rush, and Sonic Mania.

And because of the mid-credits scene, I expect Bob Chipman to rail at that even more so than he did the rest of the movie as a whole in his next episode of The Big Picture this upcoming Tuesday.  Because the last thing he needs is an endless deluge of sequels and spin-offs for the Sonic movie, complete with >!the exact same oversaturated cast of Sonic's friends as the games plaguing said sequels and spin-offs like cancer!<.

So does anyone else think Bob Chipman will do a Big Picture episode on the Sonic movie again, but with the post-credits scene?  How much more vitriol do you think he'd spread against the mid-credits scene than he did the rest of the movie as a whole?  And do you think his 2/10 review of the Sonic movie came from just his bias against the original 2D games for the Genesis and SEGA CD, as opposed to just the franchise as a whole?",2,1,1581871760.0
Robbery Bob 2,A heisting game I came up with known as The Paupers. Wanna hear more?,"So, for the last few months, I've had a concept for a game kicking around my head. Chunks of it started out as ideas for Payday 2, but gradually grew in a bit of scale to a game that takes place in the Payday universe (this does not account for the story development in PD2 at the time of writing). I don't believe I'll get it off the ground anytime soon, if ever. But, I feel like sharing the ideas I do have. So, onto the game.


The Story: The Paupers, while not entirely a story based game, does base itself around the titular Paupers, a mostly French heist crew rising to eventually become Europe's answer to the Payday Gang. Unknown to the public, a fair chunk of their heists are centered towards a mafia syndicate that was stolen from their leader. (Don't worry about antiheroism, they hit these guys for revenge, and maybe justice here or there).

Said former leader is Alexandria Kessner, 44 year old former media mogul and milieu queenpin. She descended from a long line of French/Italian mobsters under the guise of an entertainment company operating out of Marseille. While she was the head of the mafia out of inheritance, one can't say she really ran things that much. In reality, the underbosses to her rackets were holding the mob up more than she ever did. This allowed the majority of bosses who hated her to rally behind a sergeant in the mob, Gineto Dominici, who had been planning to take over for years. However, on the night Kessner was meant to be executed, she is saved by Matthias Bourcier, the now 92 year old former boss to her weapons trafficking racket. Now, Matthias offers Alexandria a spot in his ""retirement"" plan; a bank robbery crew comprised of former lackeys that actually liked Kessner (or at least could tolerate her), he himself acting as its answer to Bain. With a price on her head and her media empire out of her hands, Kessner agrees, becoming the image of the newly formed Paupers.



Gameplay: As the game is based in the Payday universe, the gameplay functions not identically, but definitely similarly to Payday 2. It has the special enemies, the bag moving, gunplay and sone other such features. This game, however, would feature certain features that help things focus on story, such as voice interaction between the heisters and Matthias, side features to allow players to explore the game's lore, and side fiction to help build the world.





There's plenty I have on the gamenl, but it's 10:00 PM where I am and I'm starting to get really sleepy. So, if anyone wants to hear the rest of what I have to say, I'll post the rest in one pr two more parts. So, with that goodnight. And remember;

Robbery Bob 2,What would make CoD Respectable again?,"Personally, Cod has fallen from a unique title to the same recycled gameplay. The games series took off with the release of CoD 4 and it was a very original game. With the tenth title soon to be released it leaves me in shame. Simply because the gameplay is now lacking tactical situations in multiplayer. No edge of look before you run around the map lighting people up leaves a very flat and unrealistic game. 

Step 1: Return the concept of stealth! When I want camoflauge those fuckers better think I'm a walking bush.

Step 2: Spawning is key to all the game modes. Eliminate spawning and being shot instantly.

Step 3: Unique tweaks to the gameplay. For example, head bobbing, soldier customization, killstreaks unlike anything we've seen, sliding into cover, and vaulting cover. Although I could name a million more, these are some that would enhance the experience.

Step 4: Better map design. I used to be so impressed with the design and how big some were, but now this isn't the case as all the maps are covered with invisible barriers and tight enclosed spaces. Variety is good in maps and mix it up a bit more when designing them.

Robbery Bob 2,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is good, just not Game of the Year good.","*Disclaimer:* I think Red Dead Redemption 2 is a good game, which I am enjoying, but it isn't \*that\* good.

(Btw this may contain game spoilers so if you do read, be prepared)

So I bought RDR2 for myself for Christmas. Mainly because of the Online as my friend had also gotten it for Christmas and we thought ""being a cowboy sounds fun"" and after the amount of time we'd put into GTA Online, we figured it would be pretty similar. But despite my gripes with the multiplayer, let's talk about the Story Mode for a second.

The story is good. I'm enjoying it. I'm invested in it. It's one of the more interesting singleplayer games that I've played. However, I don't think it deserved Game of the Year (that's not me saying that Fortnite did, so calm down

I watched a video by NakeyJakey which was really interesting. In the video, he expresses his frustrations with an open world game being so linear. Everything is so forced no matter what you did. And then I played, and I couldn't agree more.

Your camp: Your *family*. The people that are supposed to have your back. In fact, they have your back so much that no matter how little you do, how little money you add to the funds, it doesn't matter. Because the story must progress. Couldn't be something interesting where if your relationship with the camp is too low, you have to raise it before they will let you do missions etc. And the interactions with them are so disappointing. ""Howdy"" ... ""Glad to be out of those mountains"" ... ""Well I won't keep ya""

Like really? That's the best character interaction you could come up with? 1 hello, 1 relevant voice line and then goodbye.

Random interactions: Some random interactions are interesting. A couple of homeless people, the 1 in Valentine and the one in Rhodes. Both play out very similar but still interesting nonetheless. It's a shame the homeless guy in Valentine doesn't ruin the bank robbery.

And there's also no relationship between you and the characters. Nothing to build. Nothing to work on. Nothing to pursue. Let me ask Charles to go hunting with me. Let me ask Hosea and Dutch to go fishing so I can catch that legendary fish and give it to the famous fisherman. Don't give me an option once every blue moon when the option is available. And let's not mention how useless the camp is for getting resources and funds.

As I said, some random interactions are interesting. Like finding the beheaded bodies and getting the map pieces. I'm looking forward to finishing that. (Please don't spoil it. That'd be appreciated)

But I swear if I have to walk past that guy searching for Gavin without giving the option to help or get some clues I'm going to blow his brains out. I get that I'm probably supposed to just find him but some sort of clue from his shouting mate would be useful.

Linear completion: The game is very linear. Which is kinda disappointing. The best example I have would be at the very start of the game, in the mountains, when you rob the train. Let the player choose how to wire the dynamite. Let the player be the deciding factor in if the tracks blow up or not. Give me the choice to fuck it up, or make it work smoothly. Or the Valentine bank robbery. Give me the opportunity to just walk away. Don't force me to have a shootout with the whole town for the sake of it. It's boring.

*SORT OF A SPOILER*

>!During a random night in Rhodes, walking by the gun store, I get stopped by a man in the basement asking for help. And how do you free said man? Well, there's only one logical solution. Point your gun at the store owner. Even though Dutch specifically asked you not to use guns in the area of Rhodes, I can let that slide. But, you mean to tell me the gun store owner doesn't have a key to let the trapped guy go free? I really do have to shoot the chain to set him free? I'm surprised I didn't get a wanted level because despite being hidden, people still know it was you committing the crime.!<

*SPOILER*

>!Or when Colm and Dutch meet. At least give me the chance to hear the guy sneaking up behind me. Or at the very least, show the same rifle I take off my horse in the cutscene instead of your predetermined choice.!<

*SPOILER*

>!When I walk into Rhodes, give me the chance to save Sean's life by somehow not just walking down the street. Give me some sort of freedom with the game.!<

Committing crimes: Committing crimes is weird. You can wear a face mask, and people still know it was Arthur Morgan, unless you use the full mask, which doesn't really make much sense. I mean if it doesn't stop people from recognising you, why even put it in the game?

Basically, what I'm trying to say is Rockstar have made a very good story for the game, but it could have been so much better.",0,50,1546357937.0

Robbery Bob 2,Did people not like Psychonauts 2?,"Before you comment yelling at me for asking what may seem like a really dumb question, I do have a reason for asking this if you read what I have to say.

I’ve been playing Psychonauts 2 recently and I’ve been having a blast with it. As a game, it is kind of just fine, but as an example of creative people using the advantages of the medium of gaming to tell stories in cool and unique ways, it’s a fucking marvel to behold and easily one of the strongest games narratively and artistically that I’ve played.

However, something really stuck out to me playing it on Xbox. For a game that got good reviews and one that a lot of people seem to love a lot, a shockingly low percentage of people who play the game get anywhere in it. Going by the Xbox achievements, only about 47% of players beat Dr. Loboto’s level. For reference, this is the OPENING TUTORIAL LEVEL. Like we’re talking 30 minutes into the game at most. I believe I’m about 50-60% of the way through the game now (I’m at the Bob’s Bottles level) and only around 15% of players get that far (going by the achievements again)

I’m curious if this game maybe didn’t resonate with a more general gaming crowd. Obviously there’s a substantial group of people who played the game, loved it, and are super passionate about it. It’s obviously a game that resonated with a lot of people, myself included, but was wondering if it just didn’t for a lot of other people and maybe try to see why that may be. Or maybe Xbox achievements are just a terrible metric for determining how far players are actually getting into the games they play. Or maybe it’s just the Xbox community specifically that just wasn’t too into this game and the completion rates are higher on PlayStation and Steam. Still an interesting question I think",0,14,1684923229.0
Robbery Bob 2,Good retro games for a 7yo girl?,"I (19M) have various retro game consoles, including a Sega Genesis, GameCube, and PS2 (which is currently in need of repair).

Occasionally, I have my 7yo niece over and she wants to play games, but the games I have are too difficult for her to grasp, like she often stands still not knowing what to do next and then gets killed.

On Sega Genesis, I have:

* Sonic the Hedgehog 2
* Jurassic Park
* X-Men 2: Clone Wars

On GameCube, I have:

* Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy
* Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius
* Midway Arcade Treasures
* Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance

If I fix/replace my PS2, I'll also have:

* Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30
* X-Men Origins: Wolverine
* Monster House
* MX vs. ATV Unleashed
* Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Legend
* NHL 07
* Shadow of the Colossus
* SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom
* Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
* Grand Theft Auto III
* PBR: Out of the Chute
* The Powerpuff Girls: Relish Rampage
* Aeon Flux

I feel like Sega Genesis games might be good for her since most of those are simple 2D platformers. I just need some that don't have astronomically unfair difficulty, as many NES/SNES/Genesis games do.

Robbery Bob 2,"psa: when, where not to attack enemy player(s) in pvp gamemodes","everyday thousands of players, noobs, and pros alike, make mistakes, and a common one, is attacking enemy players at the worst possible time, now I 've probaly done this before, but c'mon everyone makes mistakes, and everyone learns from them, anyway here are the moments when you shouldn't attack another player
 
1. don't try to take on an entire group of players single handily, unless you have the skills and equipment necessary, because unless you do, you'll either be shot up, cut up, and or turned into a human pinball machine

2. if you're new to a game and one of your opponents is an expert, don't try to fight them head on, keep your distance, use the environment, do anything you can to take them out, but try to not attack them head on

3. if you see one enemy player, who's about to take out another enemy player, let them do it, you can attack whoever wins after the fight, or you can try to surprise both of them while they're fighting each other(this will most likely work under specific circumstances) , but don't attack either one of them, when their in the process of getting ready to fight, because something lke this might happen, bob:(sees John) mike:(sees and attacks Bob) John:(sees both mike and Bob, and kills both of them) 

4. if you see player fighting, while doing parkour at the same time, use a projectile, don't try to beat at them at their own game

5. don't attack players when their making a way to get to them and their  base, if you allow the enemy to make a path to their base, then taking them out because much easier.

•""i can do anything!""

Robbery Bob 2,Steam friend suddenly insecure,"For the purpose of this story, the friend's name is ""Bob.""

I added Bob thinking it would be good to finally have a guy to play games with. Aside from my girlfriend, he was my first steam friend. I found him on a forum in a steam friends thread. We started out by playing Path of Exile together, it was fun even though I don't normally play ARPGs.

A couple of days later, I bought Torchlight 2 since he already had a copy. (I also preordered Sonic & Allstars Racing Transformed for him since I already had a copy.) He wanted to play on elite, and since I was new to the genre, I was reluctant. I went along with it, and died during the tutorial. (The short path to the first town.) Soon after, I died during every side boss.

Needless to say, I wasn't enjoying it, and got bored so I went to bed. I just told Bob I was tired.

But, I couldn't sleep. Torchlight 2 seemed like a good game, and I couldn't get over the fact that I didn't have fun with it. So, I started a singleplayer game on veteran. It was the best fun I've had in a game in a long time.

Seeing that the only reason I wasn't enjoying the game was the difficulty Bob liked, I requested that we turn it down a bit. Bob thought this meant that I didn't like the game at all and said ""Well, we can try other games."" I explained to him that I loved the game, but couldn't stand elite difficulty. He responded with ""Alright.""

Minutes later, while continuing the single player game I had started, Bob messaged me with ""If you don't want to play, just tell me."" I told him, ""What makes you think I don't want to play?"" He never responded.

Around 3am (It is now 6:30am for reference) Bob messaged me with ""Ok.jpg""

I asked ""What?"" No response

I blocked and removed him. ( I really felt uncomfortable, and felt that he somehow became overly attached to me in only the two days that we played together.)

No idea what just happened. Please someone explain this?

Edit: I should also mention that this happened

Robbery Bob 2,"Rdr2 is great, but I have a few questions","1. Let's say you go to rob a train. How come even if you silently kill every guard, or sneak on, the train conductor always stops the train immediately? It sorta ruins the idea of robbing a train since it then becomes a stationary house for you to loot and plunder. 

2. If you commit a crime with a mask on, how come you're immediately identified as who you are. Again going back to the train robbery. I shot the only guard on sight, boarded the train, and began to sift through everything when I saw I was wanted. No witnesses, no warning, nothing. Just immediately wanted and they knew who I was. What's the point of a mask if no matter what, I'm identified and hunted? Even if I wear a full canvas hood someone can still figure out who I am

3. How come even after bounty hunters come after you, you're still wanted? I had this problem early game where I didn't have a lot of funds to pay off my bounty. On the one hand, I see where it prevents players from just going apeshit in the world and shooting up towns, but on the other hand it sorta nullifies the point of a bounty Hunter. 

4. Why do a lot of npcs immediately pull out a gun when you go to rob them. And by that, I mean the ones in well to do clothing and simple farming folk, aka people who would know not to piss off a man robbing you? It just doesn't seem that realistic to me.

Robbery Bob 2,"I offered my Indie Game for free via Torrent - Still, I get hate when I post about it because I show a message that tells: ""please buy it if you like it"".","Hi all,

I feel so bad guys. In 2016 May I made my big decision to create my childhood dream game, a business strategy game about Computer Evolution and in October I released it (in early access). I embraced the risk and the challenge and I survived.

It is a premium game that has actually a 10 USD price tag. I knew that my game will be pirated from day 1. so I decided to upload it myself to torrent sites, so people will get a virus free version with a message of mine asking them to buy the game if they like it (while they can freely play the full version).

Because the game is about starting a computer manufacturing business in the 70s the message is styled as it was shown by a Commodore 64 Home Computer.

I made [a blog post](http://progorion.com/blog/2017/10/12/support-the-games-that-you-like-or-you-wont-get-new-indie-titles-soon/) about my action and I tried to share it sometimes with appropriate communities because I wanted to generate some kind of media attention. You know, I did all of the hard work to get reviewers for my game, but this kind of guerrilla marketing was a good thing in my opinion (at least that time). It is very crowded nowadays on the market. (It is extremely hard to get attention. I offered the game in memory of Steve Jobs on his anniversary, made this torrent offer, contacted thousands of magazines, hired Italian and American marketing specialists - and invested all of my savings in the game - but only (directly contacted) YouTubers supported me and gave me a bit of traffic. My Twitter, Reddit tries, my stories, articles on my blog or anything else were unnoticed or killed in minutes.)

So the media didn't care about my retro, non-malicious, free torrent version, unfortunately. But I converted some pirates into customers that is already more than nothing! And you know what? I've tried hard, but I expected this as a possibility. That's okay. BUT I get crazy messages when I post about this thing on social media...


...And I really don't know what should I think about THIS. I get messages like these:


**""You Idiot, piracy is not theft and indie games are shit.""**

**""Make free software asshole.""**

**""Why do you care, creating games are not even work.""**


Oh, **really**?


I know the idea that piracy is not theft because when we pirate something, we just ""create illegal copies"". Some say that it is even not bad for developers because they don't lose ANY revenue (that is not true - I'd love if it was but it isn't. Not all pirates would buy the game that's true - but still devs lose a HUGE part of their income).

Of course, there are other monetization options, such as ads or micro-transactions, but those have their own flaws and they don't work on every kind of software and platform.

**Creating Indie Games is not even work?** Should I do it only as a hobby? Really?

Well, I have more than 10 years of experience in the IT sector. I was a developer, a leading developer, a project manager, product owner, I have marketing experience, I delivered a lot of products. If you are an entrepreneur and an Indie Game developer, you have to be good in a lot of things. Still creating a game is a hard and challenging task with a very high risk that the game will be a flop. Do you guys really think that creating games is not work? Really? So I just sit in front of my computer and play, right? I didn't even sleep for 3 days before the release date, you bet... because I had so much fun that time thinking about the possible outcomes and doing the unavoidable pre-release crunch. 
Bill Gates did the same before releasing Windows - did you know? You can interpret it in multiple ways... But I choose the one that tells my Indie Game means as much to me as a multi-billion dollar business for Bill.

I really like the comparison of games to movies. When you buy a ticket, you get maybe 2 hours of entertainment. For 10 bucks you can get 10-20 hours of playtime of my game. So it doesn't worth it, right?

But let's say that I'm wrong and Indie Games are shit, and creating games is not even hard work. Let's say that piracy is not theft. Okay...

How do I deserve to get these messages in that style? I don't wanna cry about the difficulties that I have because I decided to live for my passion. But man... it hurts. I'm a normal people. After I uploaded my game for free as the only logical move, after I trust you that you will support me, do you think that I deserve being hit again and again?

As my game is becoming more popular I get more and more hate messages. Fortunately I get more nice messages too, but still, this stuff really hurts me. After the extreme overwork I managed I'm already a bit burnout, and these things don't really help me.


Please Reddit tell me your opinion. It would be a great help if somebody would say that, ""hey, it's okay"" at least. ""People are stupid, don't worry"". Are we really like that? Why?

Gamers in my imagination are such an inspiring, creative, free-thinking and supportive community. Am I wrong? Or we just hate Indie Developers nowadays?

Sidenote...
I'm afraid that again I will get a lot of hate here as well. I'm prepared for that. If really that will happen, I will give up creating a conversation about the topic, so I will just you know... shut up. Can I do anything else?

An Indie Dev who didn't put micro-transactions into his premium game and said that it is for his players... *I'm looking at you EA*

UPDATE 
--

Thanks for the support guys, it really means a lot to me! I'm thinking about saving all of your comments and watch them time after time when I will need it. Indeed, I must get better in ignoring pointless hate (not including real and valuable constructive criticism that I really need as a creator). As I usually write ""I will do my best!""

It is also very interesting that after I crossposted this article to /indiegame and to /gamedev how the reactions are  different on those subreddits. Against my expectations, the gamedev subreddit had the biggest criticism of my opinion and my article. It feels like the usual player has much more empathy in the subject than people who are or would like to be game developers one day.

Some were just a bit harsh again:
""Self deprecating bullshit and whiny guilt-tripping doesn't really work. And your blog, and this post, are both full of it. Your personal problems are your own, stop trying to make me responsible for your life.""

Some still think that piracy is not theft and developers don't lose sales:
""Before: Alice has 50 dollars and 1 game. Bob has 50 dollars and no game.
After purchasing: Alice has 100 dollars and 1 game. Bob has 0 dollars and 1 game.
After piracy: Alice has 50 dollars and 1 game. Bob has 50 dollars and 1 game.
After theft: Alice has 50 dollars and no game. Bob has 50 dollars and 1 game.
Also after theft: Alice has no dollars and 1 game. Bob has 100 dollars and no game.
Do you see the difference? Piracy isn't theft. It doesn't matter whether you agree or not; the truth doesn't change based on what you think. Claiming that piracy is theft is as absurd as claiming that being rained on is theft. ""Oh no, something bad happened, I'll call it theft so people pay attention to me!"" Think about it this way: If you own a restaurant, and I walk past the restaurant without buying your food, did I reach into your pocket and take your money? No.""

Even tho these were highly downvoted, so it is not the majority. I really do think that we should talk about this more often because this is a serious issue IMHO nowadays. 

As I wrote above, I agree that not all pirate would be a customer. But still, game dev companies lose a huge amount of their revenue. Just like musicians, just like other creative people. Those who talk about research claiming that devs do not lose any sales, but do not only talk about them but link them. - and still, you can show me any research while we all see the results on the music industry that is followed by the gaming industry, unfortunately.
Internet nearly destroyed the income of indie musicians from releases. I know the situation because I also release music. I don't have shows or concerts because of my genre. I don't have a band, I'm much more a ""composer"". This means that it is literally impossible to make a living from music to me and this is definitely because of piracy.
When people have a way to get something for free, they will get it for free. That's it. If other monetization options are not possible (And sometimes they are not possible) your only support are those who don't like to bother with torrents and warez sites, OR they wanna support you.
It doesn't matter if we call piracy theft or not. Creators use their time to give you something. When you use it, but you don't pay, you don't steal from him a tangible thing indeed, but his Time. And Time is Money. You stole his money. It is the same as your time wouldn't be paid at your workplace.
Yes, game dev companies work for years and get paid only after that. Yes, sometimes they get a lot of money in a shorter period of time. But at the end, game development is really not the ""get rich fast"" way of living, much more the opposite, especially with indie games.
(You can never compare the income of a business to the income of an employee) . A business must get income upfront for the bad periods and flopped projects. A business is always risky and expensive, especially at the start.

If a company is not paid, he won't make games/music/books/movies/etc anymore. Small guys are even more vulnerable.

I really don't want to protect EA Games, but there is a tendency that makes games more expensive. Simply projects are bigger and bigger. The market is more crowded than any time in the past. Marketing is much more important than the actual game AND marketing also means more expense. So...
The DLC packages and micro-transactions are partially the results of these. If a company needs more people to create a game that must have a smaller price tag than before, how will be a business maintainable? - well by doing things like these.
Of course with EA the problem was their ""excuse"". People could understand that as everything becomes more expensive by years games can't be an exception. The technological improvements can't reduce the needed work as much as the above-mentioned things can increase it.

I think everybody pirated something in his/her life. I'm not saying that I'm better than you out there. I just do believe that if ""premium games"" will lose their space and devs will have to monetize in other ways, then players will lose a lot. 
Not every kind of games genre and platforms are good for online multiplayer (when people must buy a game) or micro-transactions (not mentioning how bad are freemium and pay to win models for society and gaming) or annoying ads. Simply there are genres and platforms that can't handle it. 

I do understand that you can't be always satisfied. For example, I'm a big FIFA fan, and not a so long time ago I was unable to play online for days because EA published the game with tons of bugs. S**t happens! Don't pre-order games, ask for a refund, write a review vote with your wallet etc. But when you are satisfied, please show support. It is very easy to know if a game is something that you are interested in and/or represents a high quality. IMHO people must understand that if they want/enjoy a game, they have to support the creator.

I wish we still had the version of Game Dev Tycoon online in which you went bankrupt because of piracy as a game developer. Remember to the guy who wrote on Steam ""why is it happening, it is not fair"".

Oh yes, and please don't be rude. Especially not while you protect theft. (My opinion is that it is still theft. Yes, not the biggest sin, but still bad.)

PLEASE talk about this! Did you get any a perspective by my text?

And again, THANK YOU! it seems that the gaming community is really what I thought. #gamersareawesome",187,98,1511637026.0
Robbery Bob 2,"Mario Odyssey sucks, Galaxy 2 was leagues better.","Galaxy 2 had a better story, gameplay, design, boss battles, levels, and gave great nostalga with the post-game Mario 64 galaxy, like you fight King Bob Omb, and Thwomp, that was great. Also, Galaxy 2 felt more like a Mario game, the controls were also better, I loved how satisfying the spin attack was. Also, I loved how creative the power ups were Spring, Rock, Bee, Ice, and Fire, all fit perfectly, and were used to their fullest potential through the levels. And all the Yoshis were great too, all of them fit in, and they were used really creatively.

SMG2 was just a treat.


SMO had a wonky progress system, you progressed by earning moons, instead of beating levels, lackluster story, meh post game, captures were more, but had less creativity put in, and less fleshed out, boring level design, power moons take was less effort to get than power stars and are way less satisfying to get, way too short, and overall nothing compared to SMG2

Robbery Bob 2,Let's rename MMORPG to MaRo,"Hi folks,

today it startled me again that MMORPG is kinda difficult to pronounce, especially if you discuss with someone and would have to say it over and over again. So I sat down and thought about it and searched for a new word and found an interesting fact:

About 90% of wikipedias entries to the topic are MMORPG and the remaining 10% are direct translations of massively multiplayer online roleplaying game (and with that REALLY long).

So I thought about a new word for it. It had to be short and easy to pronounce, but also should be linked to its origin instead of just ""a name"" like ""bob"" (""Hey, have you  heard of the new bob Guild Wars 2?""...). I started to abbreviate in different ways and then I discovered something. The important parts of the whole are Massively and Role, because Massively has to be followed by ""Multiplayer Online"" (Massively Singleplayer...yeah sure ^^) and there is also no other genre that starts with ""Role"".

So why not just start calling MMORPGs MaRo? If everyone does it, we will have a (tiny little bit) easier life and soon a new word is accepted.

**TLDR: Just abbreviate Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Game to MaRo instead of MMORPG because it holds the key features and is much easier to pronounce.**",3,20,1332873582.0

Does anyone know what the ID is for the colorful hat or if I can get another one? Does the encounter only happen once? I'd like to cheat one in.  

The reason is that I don’t agree with the fact that the clowns were able to just beat me up like that. I'm pretty strong in this game and I would've definitely beat them. I hate when games force you to lose like that without giving you a chance. Like my character can beat up giant skeletons and gangs of demon cows and lose just a few HP but somehow I don't even realize I got surrounded by clowns and immediately get jumped and defeated without the chance to fight? Like give me a chance I would've won the fight.   

If you have to force to player to not be able to fight back, then they wouldn't have lost. Same with horror games that make you freeze right before the enemy hits you like some games will make you freeze, look at the monster or whatever as they're swinging at you then you lose. How bout you let me use those 2 seconds it took to get hit to try and get away or fight back. If you have to make me freeze to beat me,  that's unfair and makes no sense and I would've won.

Okay I'm done now.

If anyone can help me get the colorful hat back I'd appreciate it :)",1,0,1617600987.0

Robbery Bob 2,"Hey friends! I have seasonal depression, help me find a game to carry me through the winter before it kicks in! YAY!","EDIT: I'm mostly looking for suggestions from the list below but will look outside it if it looks neat. /EDIT

I'm  hoping for a few titles I can  install right now and be all good to go  for a few months. I have so many  goddamn games I get decision paralysis  so all you fine friends are a  wonderful resource. I'd love some  thoughts and opinions or if you just  want to talk about games that's  cool too.

Below  is a list of  games I own but haven't touched yet that I think might be  in the  ballpark of what I want to play. Open world, modern/futuristic, rpg or  rpg lite, exploratory. I want something I can finish in 30-40  hours but  has that sweet, sweet open world if I feel like going further.  I am  absolutely terrible at games so if the skill level is too high and  I  can't adjust it down as needed I'll just give up and move on to something else, bonus points for a story mode. Finally, it needs to be on PC because I know I won't want to go sit in the middle of the room playing a console game while everyone is being all cheery and shit. Oh, also I get motion sick so any FP game that has head bobbing is right out... Metro 2033 did a number on me...

Here   are some of my favorites/what I've played that are what I'm looking for: Assassin's Creed Origins (not exactly modern but I was surprised how much I liked it and I'd give another in the series a try), Batman Arkham Asylum+City, Borderlands 1+2 (on a few occasions I got really annoyed with 2 and had to stop playing for bit), Fallout 3+NV+4 (three of my all time favorite games), GTA 3+VC+SA+4+5 (more of my all time favorite games), Horizon Zero Dawn (one of the best games I've ever played hands down), LEGO Marvel Super Heroes (the f'n casual in me loved this one when I borrowed it from my stepson), Sleeping Dogs (this is a fringe case for me since I really wanted to like it and it's exactly  my  kind of thing but the difficulty just ended up being too much and I stopped playing... included for reference I guess?), Tomb Raider 2013...  there are probably others I'm not seeing in my collection but   whatever...

Okay, now here is the sad part, are you ready for the sad part? These are the games that seem similar I've purchased but haven't gotten around to playing, or only played a few minutes at a time which totally doesn't count. (Don't even get me started on all the isolinear and fantasy games I haven't  played.)  Depression is awesome! I laugh at my mental illness instead of  dealing  with it like an adult because that's how millenials do!  Aaaaand go!

1. Y'all know Mario Party 4? Anyone remember that Bob-omb minigame where you had to last as long as possible before being exploded?

Normally I play as Peach (with exception to Mario Party 4's story mode), but for some reason, I just have to play as Waluigi for that minigame. Like, as a kid I felt I had to because he was the ""lucky character.""

2. I experienced the same glitch twice in the same event in Tony Hawk's Project 8. It was the Mike Vallely (I think that's his name) one.

I was just trying to complete the objectives, like you do, when I shot straight up. Like, I may as well have gone into orbit if the game didn't put me back where I was supposed be after 5 seconds.

3. Jumpluff was one of my favorite Pokémon for a while because of Pokémon Colosseum. I don't know why Plusle wasn't either, those two were a tag team. Jumpluff sleep powdered while Plusle destroyed with Thunderbolt.

Robbery Bob 2,"Hey friends, I was just curious. What kind of stuff would you want in a Red Dead Redemption sequal.","Since I expect it to be on next gen consoles here is my list:

1. online and split screen co-op. I imagine it to work kind of like borderlands does where you have your character and can jump in and out of other players games for side missions and what not. Once a story mission occurs it would work the same way that SWTOR handles this. Each person goes into their own scenario but has the choice to join other players. Story wise it could be where the other players are part of your gang. 

2. Option to play as a cowboy or an indian. Have one main story but weather you choose C or I depends on which side of the story you see. Also, a choice to be good or bad and have that effect story missions.

3. A larger map. I loved the size of Red Dead but I want even bigger. 

4. Train robberies to be much more open world. You could choose to be the robber or be a sheriff and either rob the train or protect it.

Robbery Bob 2,What is the Most Awe-Inspiring Moment You've Experienced in a Game?,"For me it has to be getting my hands on a N64 for the 1st time and playing **Mario 64**. It was the Launch Day in the UK, I was probably about 11 years old and had been visiting my Grandma with my Mum in the North of England. All I had been thinking about all day was that my Dad was going to be buying me the console back in London. It would be sitting there waiting for me to play. The sense of frustration was agonising. 

When i finally got home that night I rushed straight to the shiny new box with the glorious Nintendo logo I coveted (yup was a fanboy). I think that is the most excited I’ve ever been by any game or console. I'd been waiting for this for so, so long (Europe release date was at least a year after Japan) and now it was MINE! 

After hooking it up to our TV i loaded up Mario 64 and probably was shaking with anticipation. The game looked absolutely stunning, like nothing I had ever experienced before.  Once I entered Bob-omb Battlefield the 1st painting that’s when I really had the jaw to the floor moment. This world was now alive! And there was so much of it to explore! This freedom and exploration that had suddenly been made possible. This world I had only known from a 2 dimensional plane, only been able to see bits at a time. Now I could look from my starting point and see right to the top of the mountain. The whole world was mine to explore. It was the birth of the 3rd dimension to me. I felt like this was the start of something special.

Robbery Bob 2,"I love Sea of Thieves, here's why.","This is probably getting downvoted into oblivion, mainly because this goes against what the ""Norm"" is.

* *I love Sea of Thieves, why?* 

Because it brings back the child in me, the mechanics in the game are simple, easy to understand. 5 Minutes on a ship and you know 90% of whats going on, the basics are easy to understand, but you gotta put time and effort into it to master the sea. 

* *The main complaint i see*

People have is the lack of content, i fully agree, for a $60 game this is robbery, in It's current state, content wise, this game is not worth more than $10-$20, so why am i loving it so much? You make your own fun.


* *Not holding your hand* 

Sea of Thieves doesn't hand you the content of the game, they rather put you on a huge playground where you need to find friends, bring friends or play on your own. If you go down the slide on the playground, thinking ""Man, this is fun"" but the 2nd time you go down you think ""Meh, this is repetitive, this playground suck"" then of-course you're gonna get bored after an hour or two.

* *Make your own fun*

Find new friends, master different challenges differently, dont go from A to B then back to A and think that's it, Go from A, to B, to C, a bit into H, check out Q while you're there, might aswell take on O on the way back. Talk to people, create your own fun. 

* *Compared*

To games like, say CoD, Fortnite, Battlefield etc, those ""Popular"" games, you do the same thing over and over again, just like in SoT, but those games limit you to the same things over and over again, no chance to create your own unique playstyle, in CoD you spawn, die, spawn, die, might get a different weapon that is slightly different.
Fortnite, land, hope you get better loot than the guy next door, build, die, repeat, same with battlefield.

I like all those games, i have probably 1k+ hours in early CoD games (Waw, MW, MW2 etc), been an active Battlefield player since BF2, I played my share of BR with PUBG.
Most video games are repetetive, but most games lock you down to their mechanics and wont let you explode and create a unique playstyle 


* *Sea of Thieves is just like No Man's Sky*

Guess you never really played No Man's Sky then. This comparison annoys the crap outta me, for me, this is like comparing Age of Empires 2 to a game like Civilization, its the same concept but so different, is it because they ""Lack"" content as they put it? Someone please explain to me why this comparison is made


**Sea of thieves is a fun and great game if you put some time into learning how to have fun with it, and not judge it by it's current content. dont take it for what it gives you, create your own fun. If you need a game to hand you the content they provide, that's fine too, just dont slam it so hard as you're all doing**",15,39,1522857277.0

some say G2A is a trustable website while many others say it's a den of thieves but im just posting what i think is best for the gaming community. I'm not taking sides although im leaning more towards being against G2A but i'll ry to be neutral to make this statement/arguement descriptive, not biased. 

So i went to do some research and saw yes, there is beyond more hate against G2A then i even imagined. Youtube, reddit, steam and even just google searching all showed many posts of complaints of people looking to receive some help for being robbed from G2A. It's not the site itself but the marketers who sell the products on G2A that are robbing from people who just dont seem to have much money to pay the full developer price. I'm talking about steam games mostly. It seems this is where most people are suffering from robbery. But G2A happily profits from these illegal, fake keys being sold on G2A for steam games. Now i knew there was a percentage for some who actually dont sell fake keys so i took it upon myself to do some testing. I bought 5 very cheap keys off of G2A, i know not the best number to get n accurate reading but it's enough for me. So when i successfully purchased all the items, 2 of 5 keys were faulty. This is a whopping 40% frawd! Now it makes me mad to event have this number above 10-15% but like i said, the results can vary since i only did 5 purchases. I could have just gotten unlucky. I cannot think of many reasons to recommend G2A besides very cheap prices. If ur desperate then go ahead and buy some steam keys from G2A, BUT BE CAREFUL, even if someone has a 99% approval to their accont it doesnt mean he is legit. Approved-Unapproved is mostly based off of whether the Key actually works. When u sum it up, this isnt usually considering whether the keys bought are late, whether it was buggy/glitchy or even just a cracked version of the game bought. It doesnt even consider the fact of when the key is received at all! But I dont recommend this website or websites alike unless untrusted percentage is very minimal and the site is widely respected. Dont get fooled by the green secure-tag that is in the start of the url. Usually, this means the site is safe to use but when it comes to steam keys, u arent buying it from the site, ur buying it from greedy merchants or untrusable thieves with a small handful of trusty sellers. G2A does accept the profits they make from these purchases. But the G2A shield is just a further stupid feature because they dont even own up to their ""shield"". From the 40% frawd I went through, 100% were not refunded despite having G2A shield on. So both robberies were not refunded for! Unlike places like Ebay who actually provide this for free and even tho items are sold only by valve, steam has usually an 100% refund guarantee as long as its 14 days before ppast purchase is gone by and uve only played less than 2 hours of the game. Even for the worst reasons like the game wasnt fun or the game just didnt suit me all are acknowledged for and refunds are expected. Ebay has a slightly different policy but I havent first handedly used Ebay so im not gonna confirm the policies they follow.

So, do I trust G2A, well from the 5 times i purchased keys from them there was a 40% frawd, And from that 40%, 100% were not refunded by G2A... SO NO I DONT TRUST G2A and I dont recommend u guys do either.",1,5,1471074944.0

Kaos is a villain who is incompetent, but still shouldn't be underestimated. He is always out to capture and defeat the Skylanders, their master Eon, and the humans who summon the Skylanders, the Portal Masters. Along the way, you can unlock treasure chests, story scrolls to find out the lore of Skylands, and winged sapphires to allow less gold to be spent at Persephone, a fairy you can buy upgrades from.

The Last Of Us Part 2 - Naughty Dogs - jesus!
FIFA - EA Sports - pure robbery!

Unfortunately all types of games that i on paper, would enjoy playing - but unfortunately get robbed by game companies and developers time and time again!

EA Sports (banned) - been playing fifa since the first titles - the unplayable trash they have put on the marked the last 10 years without fixing the issues many people have been complaining about for years - is a joke - + the feeling that you just buy an update at a full games price!

Ubisoft (banned) - all their open world games - feels like the same: boring stories, boring characters, predictable side missions, endless boring cutscenes etc. Repetitive gameplay and animations.
Watch Dogs Legion and AC Valhalla was the final final straw for me....one game could have been a mod of the other. With that comes a history of downgrading graphics for Watch Dogs 1 and Ghost Recon Wildlands - crap AC releases like Unity and Syndicate.

CD Project Red: when gamers makes games? I thought so - the Witcher 3 - was a brilliant game - released ONE MANY PLATFORMS - so i bought into the Cyberpunk hype - just to be f**ked by another game company! While not on my personal banned list yet - i have absolutely no faith or trust in them anymore - and will never pre-order any of their titles again.

Naughty Dogs: while TLOU2 from an technical and visual point of view was outstanding - the story was so thin written - that i really have a hard time understanding, why no one at  Naughty Dogs said: hey do you think people will like Joel to be murdered within the first 10 min of play? And spend most of the game playing as his murderess? Deluded faith in themselves and not their consumers - could be the explanation here. I don't trust Naughty Dogs - and it started with the last Uncharted - where I felt half the game was the ending and very very repetitive gameplay through that last half of the game.
Naughty Dogs was 2013's CD Project Red - ND messed up and lost a lot of trust from me and other gamers.

Who is left? To mainly deliver a good open worldish game?
The only one who haven't hugely disappointed me YET - are Rockstar Games - they might dwell on games with dlcs etc - but have no one's forcing you to get them? But ROCKSTAR GAMES better deliver on GTA6 or i think a lot of people will get fed up with the game industry! 

In general you should never pre-order, buy expansions or dlcs - to put the pressure on the game industry to deliver! Just think if a game had the expansions and dlcs from the start? Wouldn't it be the perfect game?
Would it be unfair to demand? That we actually get what we're paying for? 

The game industry are walking on some MIGHTY THIN ICE these years - of course if you're going to buy their games over and over - no matter if they stole your money in their previous title - then it won't change anything. We gamers need to put more pressure on game developers who keeps throwing trash at us and steal our money - for a project - that was showcased with trailers and demos that have nothing to do with the actual game released! Demo I believe, is a demonstration of a finished product - that you led to believe is not a alpha or a beta version? 

Stand up fellas - we need to boycott bad gaming companies if they're to listen to us!",0,28,1608112414.0
Robbery Bob 2,I'm making a Bob-omb costume and I need suggestions.,"First off, I'm sorry if I'm breaking any rules. This just seemed the most fitting place to post this.

So I've just now been invited to a Super Mario/Mushroom Kingdom themed Halloween party (yes, it's very short notice), and after seeing the complication with a Bowser costume, I've opted to go as a Bob-omb. I think I've got the majority of it figured out, save for the main body. Does Reddit have any suggestions for something I might be able to use? I'm 6'2"", if that makes any difference.

TL;DR: What can I use as a body for a Bob-omb costume?",0,1,1319510890.0
Robbery Bob 2,"Why Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl will never have voice acting and most likely no Jimmy Neutron, Fairly Oddparents, and other popular Nickelodeon franchises","Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is one of the best Smash clones I have ever played. However it is lacking something glaring, which is voice acting. Every YT review mentioned it and how it makes the game soulless. Many other Nickelodeon video games have voice acting and it is done very well. Look at the Nicktoons Unite games. However there is only one culprit behind this, and it is GameMill Entertainment, the publisher of the game. Not Ludosity, the devs, oh no no no. 


**GameMill** 

Their last Nickelodeon licensed game, Nickelodeon Kart Racers 2, had no voice acting and has the same IPs represented as NASB. Avatar, Korra, SpongeBob, CatDog, Rocko, Hey Arnold, Ren and Stimpy, Rugrats, Danny Phantom, TMNT, and The Loud House. Only The Wild Thornberrys is newly represented. No Jimmy Neutron, Timmy Turner, or Jenny. 


All of the other Nickelodeon Super titles on PC (which had the same Smash gameplay apparently) had voice acting and surprisingly, more diverse IPs. WinxClub, live action characters, etc. It is very possible that GameMill hasn’t secured the rights to Frederator and other second party labels to Nick to secure the rights to other characters. Why? Because they are cheap asf. This label shits out shovelware after shovelware and makes expenses as low as possible. Just google “GameMill Entertainment” and click the Video Games tab and you can see it. 

So don’t expect voicelines, or renacting Jimmy Timmy Power Hour anytime soon.",1,1,1634077374.0

Robbery Bob 2,PS1-PS4 games you would like to see rereleased on PS5?,"I grew up with PS1 and PS2, so I have a lot of respect for the PlayStation brand. I regret having skipped the PS3 in favor of an Xbox 360 because of an old article that claimed the controllers would be totally useless once the battery ran out. Sounds pretty damn silly in retrospect, but nonetheless that’s what prompted my decision. I would later make up for it by buying a PS4 in mid-2015, but I wish it was backwards compatible with PS3 games (like that system was with PS1 games and even PS2 games in earlier models) so I could still get a chance to play Gran Turismo 5 and 6 (particularly because the original was the first video game I ever played). Fortunately, thanks to the recent patent from Sony that guarantees backwards compatibility, I may finally get my chance without having to get a PS3.

Of course, I really like the idea of being able to use my original copies of my PS1, PS2, and PS4 games, if Sony is still kind enough to allow for physical copies. But as much as I prefer the traditional way of doing things, I must say it would be awesome to see the games rereleased on the PlayStation Store like with PS3 and PS4, and have the added benefit of obtaining trophies for the PS1 and PS2 titles. So with that said, what games would you like to see being given this kind of treatment?

Here’s a list of games that I would totally repurchase for my PS5 (excluding games that are either being remastered or already have been like Crash and Spyro, though I love those games so much that I would’ve put them here regardless):
